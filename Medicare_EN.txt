##description	Medicare is the federal health insurance program for people 65 years of age or older, certain younger people with disabilities, and people with End-Stage Renal Disease. This glossary explains terms in the Medicare program, but it is <b> not </b> a legal document. The official Medicare program provisions are found in the relevant laws, regulations, and rulings.
A TIER	A 'TIER'<br>\nis a specific list of drugs. Your plan may have several tiers,and your copayment amount depends on which tier your drug is listed.Plans can choose\ntheir own tiers, so members should refer to their benefit booklet or contact the plan for more information.

ACCREDITED|ACCREDITATION	ACCREDITED (ACCREDITATION)<br>\nMeans having a seal of approval.  Being accredited means that a facility or health care organization has met certain quality standards.  These\nstandards are set by private, nationally recognized groups that check on the quality of care at health care facilities and organizations.

ADDITIONAL BENEFITS	Health care services not covered by Medicare and reductions in premiums or cost sharing for Medicare-covered services. Additional benefits are\nspecified by the MA Organization and are offered to Medicare beneficiaries at no additional premium. Those benefits must be at least equal in value\nto the adjusted excess amount calculated in the ACR. An excess amount is created when the average payment rate exceeds the adjusted\ncommunity rate (as reduced by the actuarial value of coinsurance, copayments, and deductibles under Parts A and B of Medicare). The excess\namount is then adjusted for any contributions to a stabilization fund. The remainder is the adjusted excess, which will be used to pay for services\nnot covered by Medicare and/or will be used to reduce charges otherwise allowed for Medicare-covered services. Additional benefits can be subject\nto cost sharing by plan enrollees. Additional benefits can also be different for each MA plan offered to Medicare beneficiaries.

APPEAL	An appeal is a special kind of complaint you make if you disagree with a decision to deny a request for health care services or payment for services\nyou already received. You may also make a complaint if you disagree with a decision to stop services that you are receiving.
