Anti Anorexia and Bulimia League	A  group organization formed initially by <a href="http://www.california.com/~rathbone/names.htm#David Epston">David Epston</A> and developed and applied by Stephen Madigan in 1993.  They have been defined as &quotCommunities of people who have taken a stand against the oppressive  regimes of anorexia and bulimia in their own lives and are prepared to  share their stories with others who are struggling with these problems." (see: Gerald Monk (Editor), et al Narrative  Therapy in Practice - The Archaeology of Hope (Jossey-Bass Psychology  Series) Hardcover 1996 Jossey-Bass, Inc.)
CLS	Collaborative Language Systems, the name given to <a href="http://www.california.com/~rathbone/names.htm#HarleneAnderson">Anderson </A> and <a href="http://www.california.com/~rathbone/names.htm#Harold (Harry)">Goolishian</A> 's form of therapy in which the therapist takes a deliberately '<a href="bword://not-knowing">not-knowing</A> ' stance.  <a href="http://www.neosoft.com/~hgi/">Click here to goto a website on CLS </A> at the Houston-Galveston institute.
Cartesian	Having to do with the philosopher Descartes.

Communicative Action	<a href="http://www.california.com/~rathbone/names.htm#Jürgen Habermas">Habermas</A> ' term. Communicative action is rational&nbspcommunication for the purpose of cooperative solidarity.  Habermas talks about different kinds of communication and the way they work.
DSM-IV	Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (of Mental Disorders), fourth edition.  This manual is published by the American Psychiatric Association and is a list of mental disorders together with detailed definitions.  The pages describing a disorder typically list from 4 to 15 criteria and allow the diagnosis if a certain number of these criteria are met.  Diagnoses are differential, that is, the diagnostician reads through the criteria to find the best fit even though it is possible for a given person to fall within more than one very similar categories.  The DSM-IV guides the diagnostician in this differential effort by saying things such as "Panic Disorder is not diagnosed if the Panic Attacks are judged to be...." and this is so even if the patient would otherwise fit the criteria for a "panic disorder."  Many insurance companies require a DSM-IV diagnosis in order to pay for therapy.  These diagnoses are typically given by either psychiatrists or clinicial psychologists.  The DSM-IV was published in 1994.  The earlier editions of this manual were as follows: DSM-I 1952, DSM-II 1968, DSM-III 1979, DSM-III-R 1987.  DSM I and DSM II were quite short and non-specific in criteria compared to later editions, they also included a number of "disorders" that are no longer listed as forms of mental illness
Foucauldian	a common way of spelling or meaning what we would ordinarily imply by &quotFoucaultian", or related to <A href="http://www.california.com/~rathbone/names.htm#Foucault">Foucault</A> .
Investigations	Shorthand term for <a href="http://www.california.com/~rathbone/names.htm#Wittgenstein">Wittgenstein</A> 's major later book,<a href="http://www.california.com/~rathbone/refer.htm#Wittgenstein-63">The Philosophical Investigations</A> , in which he criticizes his earlier book, the <A HREF="bword://Tractatus">Tractatus </A> and his own <A HREF="bword://picture theory of language">picture theory of language.</A>
Katherine's story	<a href="http://www.california.com/~rathbone/names.htm#KatherineLevine">Katherine Levine </A>once told a story of doing therapy in a way that I believe illustrates the postmodern spirit. She described her client as a young rape victim who one day asked her therapist, "Am I still a virgin?  Now that I have been raped?"  And Katherine, moved by the client's sadness spoke from her heart saying, "Oh, I think you're still a virgin!" and she talked for a while explaining why she thought this. Then she noticed that the girl was not listening, and Katherine said, "But that's not what you think, is it?"  And the girl shook her head "no" and began talking about what she thought.
Lebenswelt	<a href="http://www.california.com/~rathbone/names.htm#Edmund Husserl">Husserl</A>'s word for lived world of institutional and mundane experience. <BR>It is he world created by people although they are unaware of doing so.
Lyotard's paradox	The paradox that one must become a dictator in order to set up a system in which the oppressed can have a voice.  This paradox is elaborated by Samuel Weber in his afterword to Lyotard's interview published in English as <a href="http://www.california.com/~rathbone/refer.htm#Lyotard 85 JG">Just Gaming</A> .
NT	<A HREF="bword://Narrative Therapy">Narrative Therapy</A>
Narrative Therapy	Although the term <I>narrative therapy </I>is sometimes used more broadly, on PMTH, it usually refers to a form of therapy introduced by <A href="http://www.california.com/~rathbone/names.htm#MichaelWhite">White</A> and <A href="http://www.california.com/~rathbone/names.htm#David Epston">Epston</A> in their book, <a href="http://www.california.com/~rathbone/refer.htm#White&Epston-90">Narrative Means to Therapeutic Ends</A> .
New criticism	A fashionable approach to literary criticism in the nineteen forties, fifties and sixties. The idea was that each literary work could be analyzed without reference to the author, his life or his time,or anything outside the text itself.  For some new critics, the preferred text was poetry which was not to be violated by paraphrase or similar devices meant to elucidate the text.   New criticism was not postmodern because it held that there was one true meaning for each text and ignored the ambiguity of text.  <a href="http://www.sou.edu/English/Hedges/Sodashop/RCenter/Theory/Explaind/ncritexp.htm">Click here for more detail</A>.  <a href="http://www.lawrence.edu/dept/english/courses/60A/newcrit.html#newint">Or click here.</A>
Other	The term "Other" with a capital "O" is used throughout the postmodern literature.  It means something quite different from the word "other" with a small "o".  Whereas the "other" is just someone else, each person has an "Other".  It is the inner voice that each of us hear evaluating us in our minds.  Our "Other" might say, "Job well done."  Or it might say, "You shouldn't have done that."  It is possible to argue with one's Other.  In fantasy one would simply explain to this imaginary voice why it is that one should do things as one did.  It is also possible to hear another real person "speaking with the voice of the Other."  This would mean that the other real person is saying (or one thinks she is saying) what the inner voice of the Other says.
PMTH	PMTH is the acronym name for <A HREF="bword://Postmodern Therapies">Postmodern Therapies</A> .  It is the name for a listserv that discusses the philosophical and clinical issues surrounding postmodernism and postmodern therapy. <a href="http://www.california.com/~rathbone/pmth2">Click here</A> to learn more about PMTH.
PMTH council	This is an advisory board for PMTH consisting of <A href="http://www.california.com/~rathbone/names.htm#Leonard Bohanon">Leonard Bonahan,</A> <A href="http://www.california.com/~rathbone/names.htm#KatherineLevine">Katherine Levine,</A> <a href="http://www.california.com/~rathbone/names.htm#Solomon Yusim">SY Yusim,</A> <A href="http://www.california.com/~rathbone/names.htm#Tom Hicks">Tom Hicks</A> , <A href="http://www.california.com/~rathbone/names.htm#Craig Smith">Craig Smith,</A> <A href="http://www.california.com/~rathbone/names.htm#Lois Shawver">Peter Rober</A> . This advisory board assists <A href="http://www.california.com/~rathbone/names.htm#Lois Shawver">Lois Shawver</A> in making decisions about the direction of PMTH.  <A href="http://www.california.com/~rathbone/names.htm#Leonard Bohanon">Leonard Bonahan</A> serves as co-manager of the list as well as a member of this advisory board.
Paralogue	a term invented by <A href="http://www.california.com/~rathbone/names.htm#Lynn_Hoffman">Lynn Hoffman</A> .A paralogue is an a written format that maintains the voices of the individual authors but connects them in such a way that they read each other’s contribution and influence each other so as to yield a sense of <a href="bword://paralogy">paralogical</A> progress.
Postmodern Therapies News	The Name of the newsletter that reports on the conversation and topics happening in the postmodern therapies online community <A HREF="bword://PMTH">PMTH</A>.  See the latest edition of Postmodern Therapies News by <a href="http://www.california.com/~rathbone/pmth.htm">clicking here</A>
Postmodern therapies	The name for psychotherapies that reject the modernist model and are influenced by Wittgenstein or Lyotard.  It is also sometimes used to characterize Narrative Therapy (which is more generally seen as poststructural) or other therapies influenced by Foucault.  Postmodern therapies is also the full name for <A HREF="bword://PMTH">PMTH.</A>   Also see, <A HREF="bword://Postmodern Therapies News">Postmodern Therapies News</A>.
Reflecting Team	a procedure introduced by Tom Andersen in his book, The Reflecting Team.  The preferred name by Anderson, however, is &quotreflecting process." In this procedure, professionals shun their professional voice in order to hold a more personal kind of converation about a group of clients in therapy in earshot of those clients.  After the professionals speak, the clients have an opportunity to comment back.   Modified versions of reflecting teams have been introduced by others.The Collaborative Language Systems form of therapy uses reflecting teams, for example, as does Narrative Therapy.  For more details <a href="http://www.california.com/~rathbone/hoffman2.htm">click here</A> .
SFT	<a href="bword://Solution Focused Therapy">Solution Focused Therapy</A>
Solution Focused Therapy	(SFT) is a form of brief therapy inaugurated by Steve De Shazer.  It works to help clients think forward towards solutions rather than become entrenched in reflection on their problems.
Tack	Tack is a metaphor used sometimes on PMTH to replace Lyotard's concept of a &quotruse" which is one of the ingredients of <A href="bword://paralogy">paralogy</A> .  Tacking is the manouever that is performed when the boat changes from one tack to the other. This involves the boat turning through about 90-100°, with the wind passing around the bows (front) of the boat.  Normally this is done repeatedly, say once every 5 minutes in a dinghy race in order to progress to windward. For instance if one wishes to reach a bouy that is directly in the dircetion in which the wind is coming from, the boat is sailed close hauled on one tack, and then close hauled on the other tack.
Taos Institute	<a href="http://www.serve.com/taos/founder.html">Click here to go to a related website</A>
The Enlightenment	A philosophical movement of the 18th century that emphasized the use of reason to scrutinize previously accepted doctrines and traditions which it called &quotsuperstition."  The Enlightenment philosophy encouraged the American and French revolutionary overthrow of aristocracies and replaced it with the dream of science liberating  us from the scourge of one human's inhumanity to another.  Postmodernism is disillusioned with the power of the Enlightenment dream to bring us to this utopia and points, among other things, to the science behind the Nazi slaughter of the Jews in World War II.
The text stands alone	When the "text stands alone" it is like discovering a post-it in a book in the library that contains an interesting but ambiguous note.  Picture this as a difficult book on statistics.  Read in a certain way the post-it makes the book more intelligible, but the post-it is itself scribbled so that it is not clear that the author meant.  Still, interpreting the post-it as we do, we can make a kind of sense of the statistical text that is very hard to understand. <p>If we say, "Forget the author's real intentions.  Understanding it this way helped me and that's all I care about," then we are letting the text of the post it "stand alone."
Tractatus	The shorthand name for <a href="http://www.california.com/~rathbone/names.htm#Wittgenstein">Wittgenstein</A>'s influential first book, The Tractatus <BR>Logico-Philosophicus.
Truth (or TRUTH)|Truth	A spelling of the word "truth" that is capitalized in part are in full is shorthand for a version of truth that reflects <A HREF="bword://naive realism">naive realism. </A>  (also see <A HREF="bword://realism">realism</A>.)
Verstehen	a kind empathic inuition of what other people are thinking and feeling.
Vienna Circle	A group of philosophers in Vienna during the early part of the twentieth century.  They took the position that all that could not be verified was nonsense.
abduction	a reasoning procedure aimed at coming up with good hypotheses to explain observed cases.  The success of abduction is compromised if all rival hypotheses are equally compatible with the evidence (i.e., <A href="bword://underdetermined">underdetermined</A> .)  Abduction was an area of philosophy expanded upon by <A href="http://www.california.com/~rathbone/names.htm#Charles Sunders Peirce">Peirce</A> .
agonistics	a combative striving to overcome an opponent.
akrasia	ancient Greek word for weakness of the will.
allopathy	A method of treating disease with remedies  that produce effects different from those caused by the disease itself.
alterity	lack of identification with some part of one's personality or one's community, differentness, otherness.
analog communication	a nonverbal communication transmitted through body signs and actions.
analysand	the psychoanalytic patient is often referred to as an <I>analysand</I>.
analytic philosophy	a currently dominant form of philosophy in the English speaking world. It maintains that philosophy is a (logical) analysis of concepts.  Analytic philosophers attempt to identify concepts that are the same in different languages (although, of course, expressed with different words).  See <a href="http://www.california.com/~rathbone/names.htm#W. V. O. Quine">Quine </A> and <a href="http://www.california.com/~rathbone/names.htm#Donald Davidson">Davidson</A> .  Analytic philosophy has nothing to do with psychoanalysis.
anomie	social instability, alienation and a sense of purposelessness cause by a steady erosion of standards and values.
apodictic truths	an imaginary concept of truth in which it is supposed that we know something with absolute certainty.  To be an apodictic truth there must be no possibility of mistake.
aporia	Wonder and amazement before the confusing puzzles and paradoxes of our lives and of the universe.  Socrates and the other ancient philosophers tried to evoke the philosophic spirit in young men by awakening their aporia, not by simply providing answers to these puzzles.
appreciative inquiry	a form of inquiry initiated by the <a href="http://www.serve.com/taos/founder.html">Taos Institute</A> It is designed for use in organizational consultations and intended to result in organizational transformation.
atomic propositions	part of early Wittgenstein's <a href="bword://picture theory of language">picture theory of language</A> . An atomic proposition is a statement that consists either of simple unanazlyeable pictures of a corresponding reality or else is composed of such pictures.
autopoetic unity	a single living organism, such as a person, or a flea (<a href="http://www.california.com/~rathbone/names.htm#Humberto Maturana">Maturana</A> and <a href="http://www.california.com/~rathbone/names.htm#Francisco Varela">Varela</A> )  It is their organization that defines them as unities.  There are first and second order autopoetic unities.  When organisms undergo <a href="bword://structural coupling">structural coupling,</A> they become a new composite unity which is called second-order.
autopoiesis	<a href="http://www.california.com/~rathbone/names.htm#Humberto Maturana">Maturana</A> 's and <a href="http://www.california.com/~rathbone/names.htm#Francisco Varela">Varela</A> 's term, autopoiesis is<B>  </B>the system that makes living beings autonomous systems.
binary	having two forms, or two parts
binary thinking	If you use &quotbinary thinking," you are a person who sees no gray, no fuzziness between your categories.  Everything is black or white.
borderzone	<A href="http://www.california.com/~rathbone/names.htm#Lyotard">Lyotard's</A>   term for an area of discussion that allows people who speak within different schools of thought, or regions of langauge, to come together and communicate.  So, a borderzone would be an area of discussion, for example, where a teenage son and a parent might find some home of making sense together.  Disputes can surely happen in borderzones, but there is also the possibility of meaningful exchange.  Lyotard also used a Latin term "<A href="bword://pagus">pagus</A> " to refer to borderzones.
bracket	phenomenologist, Husserl's, word.  It means to philosophically ignore what exists beyond perception (<a href="bword://patterned jello">patterned jello</A> ) in order to thoroughly explore how conceptualization and construal cause us to experience things the way we do.   In some contexts, this term also means to philosophically ignore some aspects of experience in order to focus other aspects.
bricolage	to use something that is easy at hand for a tool it was not designed for.  A brick used for a hammer, for exaple, is bricolage.  Postmodern authors talk about the way language grows by the means of established terms being used as a kind of bricolage, as a brick might be used for a hammer.
catachresis	to misuse or strain the use of words
catharsis	when therapy is thought of as "catharsis" is it thought as a way of emptying oneself of frustration and misery.  If a person says that an experience is "cathartic," it means that pent up resentment or emotion was expressed and no longer demands the same expression.
chimpanzoid	a term <a href="http://www.california.com/~rathbone/names.htm#Vygotsky">Vygotsky</A> used to refer to the developmental period in which the child learns some language before thought and speech come together.
cogito	Literally, "cogito" is Latin for "I think," but in philosophical circles this term is often used as shorthand for Descartes famous dictum "I think therefore I am," which, in <BR>Latin, is "Cogito ergo sum."
commodification	the subordination of public and private realms to the logic of capitalism. <BR>In other words, things (e.g., friendship, women) are valued for their commercial value.  With commodification aspects of our lives that are culturally conditioned take on the mythology of being "natural."
construct validity	one of the forms of <A href="bword://validity of operational definition">validity</A> for an <A href="bword://operational definition">operational definition</A> .  If a test has &quotconstruct validity" then it measures what it says it measures, or rather there is evidence that it measures what it says it measures.  There are various standard ways of trying to establish that a test has &quotconstruct validity."  One standard way is triangulation.  If another test that is supposed to measure the same thing gives the same results as the test being studied, then this is used as evidence for construct validity in the test being studied.  Obviously, however, if the first test was itself invalid, then its correspondence with the test being studied would not be a good test.  No test for construct validity is without similar inherent problems.  (See <A HREF="bword://face validity">face validity</A> .)
constructionism	short for <a href="bword://social constructionism">social constructionism</A>
constructivism	Is sometimes contrasted wth social constructionism (sometimes called <BR>merely "<A HREF="bword://constructionism">constructionism</A>.")  Constructivism is based on a theory of cognitive perspective.  Each individual has a kind of cognitive bias and all happenings  in the world are colored by that bias.
contingent	in philosophical texts, this term often refers to that which is can come and go (contingent on circumstances.)
conversability	In a recent unpublished paper <A href="http://www.california.com/~rathbone/names.htm#Richard_Rorty">Rorty</A> hypothesized that the <A href="bword://stubbornness">stubbornness</A> shown by <A href="http://www.california.com/~rathbone/names.htm#Spinoza,">Spinoza</A> and <A href="http://www.california.com/~rathbone/names.htm#Socrates_-">Socrates</A> , along with their  conversability, might be the reason that we are inclined to see them as wise.
correspondence theory of truth	a philosophical idea that truth consists in the correspondence between language and reality.  The statement, "There is a chair in the corner" is true if there is a real chair in a real corner which corresponds to the statement.  There are problems with the correspondence theory of truth.  For example, what would be necessary for the statement, "Tomorrow he will likely feel better"? to be true? Would he actually have to feel better tomorrow?  What states of affairs would have to exist in order for it to be true that it is likely he would feel better?
countertransference	feelings that the psychoanalyst has for the <A href="bword://analysand">analysand</A> that are more a reflection of the analyst's personal history than a reaction to the behavior or characteristics of the analysand.  This is the opposite of transference.
critical distance	<a href="http://www.california.com/~rathbone/names.htm#Ian Parker">Ian Parker </A>and <a href="http://www.california.com/~rathbone/names.htm#Frederic Jameson">Frederic Jameson</A>'s term.  We put the <A HREF="bword://discourse">discourse </A>behind us, consign it to the past, as we analyze it.
critical listening	listening for misakes, flaws of thinking, or problems in what the speaker is saying.  It is contrasted with <A HREF="bword://generous listening">generous listening</A>.
critical reading	to read in a way that looks for fallacies and defects in the writing.  It is to be contrasted with "<A HREF="bword://reading generously">reading generously</A> ."  This distinction between generous and critical reading is analogous to a parallel distinction between <A href="bword://generous listening">generous</A> and <A href="bword://critical listening">critical listening</A> .
critical theory	Although the term is sometimes used more broadly, in most contexts it refers to the school of thought represented by the &quotFrankfurt School," which is a school of thought that combines psychoanalysis and Marxism.  A key text of this school of thought is <A href="http://www.california.com/~rathbone/refer.htm#Adorno & Horkheimer 72 - dialectic of enlightenment">Adorno &amp; Horkheimer 72</A>
cybernetics	a study of the control processes in biological and artificial systems.  Cybernetics reduces the field to a system that maintains itself by the mutual influence of its parts.
cyberspace	an internet word.  All of the internet occurs in "
decenter	to look at the world through another's eyes or to include the other's perspective within one's own vision of things.
deconstruction	A term that, for all practical purposes, was introduced in the literature by Derrida.  It means to undermine the conceptual order imposed by a concept that has captivated our imaginations and ways of seeing things.  (See <a href="http://www.california.com/~rathbone/refer.htm#Shawver-96">Shawver, 1996</A>) see "<A HREF="bword://deconstruction quilt">deconstruction quilt</A>"
deconstruction quilt	a visual representation for <A HREF="bword://deconstruction">deconstruction </A> and <A HREF="bword://differAnce">differAnce</A> . <a href="http://www.california.com/~rathbone/decon%20quilt.htm">Click here</A> to see an image of the deconstruction quilt and read a related article.
deduction	in ordinary language, a deduction is just reasoning your way to a conclusion.  In philosophy, however, it has a more technical sense, and means that the reasoning conforms to the rules of <A HREF="bword://deductive logic">deductive logic</A>.
deductive logic	a way of reasoning from one set of statements to another.  It has the form: If this is the case and this is the case, then we can conclude tha this other thing is the case, too.  People use deductive logic in a loose way when they think and talk, but it is used in a highly formalized way in philosophy circles.  There, in the last century especially, the rules of logic become quite complex and the deduction (the reasoning leading to the conclusion) follows rules that are so formal that they are often thought to be, or hoped to be, a kind of mathematical calculus.  Note that deduction does not require any factual or observed information.  One can deduce something false if one reasons with false ideas or premises.  Contrast "deductive logic" with "inductive logic."
dialectic	In classical Greece, a process of discussion that is illustrated in <a href="http://people.delphi.com/~gkemerling/ph/plat.htm">Plato</A> 's dialogues was called dialectic.  It is a way of questioning and conversing and reasoning.  <A href="http://www.california.com/~rathbone/names.htm#Kant,">Kant</A> referred to the &quottranscendental dialectic" as metaphysical reasoning that tried, without success (or possible success) to figure out what the truth was beyond our senses.  The German philosopher, <A href="http://www.california.com/~rathbone/names.htm#Georg Hegel">Hegel</A> , applied the term to a process of development in which one idea (the thesis) begets its opposite (the antithesis) and the two come together to form a synthesis. <A href="http://www.california.com/~rathbone/names.htm#Karl Marx">Marx</A> built on this Hegelian notion of dialecic in his version of dialectical materialism.
dialogic	having to do with dialogue.  A dialogic theory of therapy would be one which emphasized the importance of there being room for different opinions to be expressed.
differAnce	This is a term coined by Jacques <A href="http://www.california.com/~rathbone/names.htm#Derrida">Derrida</A> , father deconstructionism.  (However, Derrida  does not capitalize the &quotA".)  Derrida explains &quotdifferance" as that which is different and deferred (put out of mind).  It's a philosophical term that causes many people headaches and Derrida does not explain it in an introductory way.  However, in many contexts, you will have a rough understanding of what is said if you think of the differAnce as the shadows of our understanding, something we know but forget and need to be reminded.  Or, you might think of it as the cultural Unconscious, something that the whole culture puts mostly out of mind. <a href="http://www.california.com/~rathbone/differan.htm">Click here for on differAnce.</A>   Arguably, the differAnce is a source of our creativity.  Mostly we forget it, but sometimes people think of these largely unconscious aspects of life and weave them creatively into new moments of understanding.
differend	<a href="http://www.california.com/~rathbone/names.htm#Lyotard">Lyotard's</A> term for a dispute resulting from the fact that one party cannot voice her complaints (or points) because the other insists on speaking within a different language game or genre of discourse (such as one person speaking within narration and the other within speculation).
discourse	sometimes this term refers to any kind of talk, but often it refers to particular unified ways of talking that represents a kind of conversation scross texts from different but related communities.
discourse analysis	inquiry that leads us to reflect critically and creatively on our common ways of life.
dominant discourse	A <a href="http://www.california.com/~rathbone/names.htm#Foucault">Foucaultian</A> term that indicates a certain way thinking and talking is the most common and most accepted way.  Often it implies an institutionalized way of thinking about things.
dominant narrative	a term that <A href="http://www.california.com/~rathbone/names.htm#MichaelWhite">Michael White</A> and <A href="http://www.california.com/~rathbone/names.htm#David_Epston">David Epston</A> seem to have picked up from <a href="http://www.california.com/~rathbone/names.htm">Jerome Bruner</A> .
erasure	(or &quotunder erasure" or &quotputting [something] under erasure" ).  This is <A href="http://www.california.com/~rathbone/names.htm#Derrida">Derrida</A> 's term.  It means presenting our ideas as though they were undeconstructable but with awareness that they can be deconstructed. One might say, &quotI say [such and such], but I am putting it under erasure."
externalization	a term introduced by <A href="http://www.california.com/~rathbone/names.htm#MichaelWhite">Michael White</A> and <A href="http://www.california.com/~rathbone/names.htm#David Epston">David Epston</A> .  It is the name given to the process of asking relative influence questions that assists the client in separating from a pressing problem so that it is possible to see the self as authoring a life that weakens or overcomes the influence of the problem.
face validity	one of the forms of <A href="bword://validity of operational definition">validity</A> for an <A href="bword://operational definition">operational definition</A> .  If an operational definition has &quotface validity" then, on the face of things, it appears to measure what it is supposed to measure.  If a test that called itself a test for creativity, for example, consisted of qusetions testing the subject's ability to memorize, then the test would not have &quotface validity."  This would be so even if later studies showed that people who scored high on this test actually were more creative than people who scored low on the test.  Contrast &quotface validity" with "<A HREF="bword://construct validity">construct validity</A> ."
facticity	objectivity, an illusory objectivity
facts	a concept that differentiates the social constructionist from teh realist. The realist says that facts exist independent of our construction.  The social constructionist feels that we socially construct facts.  Compare <a href="http://www.california.com/~rathbone/names.htm#Tom Strong">Tom Strong</A> ,'s <a href="http://www.california.com/~rathbone/strong3.htm">review </A> of <a href="http://www.california.com/~rathbone/names.htm#JonathanPotter">Jonathan Potter</A> 's social <a href="bword://constructionism">constructionist</A> concept of &quotfacts" with <a href="http://www.california.com/~rathbone/names.htm#Jerry Shaffer">Jerry Shaffer</A> 's <a href="http://www.california.com/~rathbone/searles.htm">review </A> of <a href="http://www.california.com/~rathbone/names.htm#Searles,">John Searle</A> 's concept of facts, and ask yourself if the dispute is a <A href="bword://differend">differend.</A>
felt sense	Shawver's term for Lyotard's word <a href="bword://pagan">&quotpagan"</A>.
finitism	The belief that there are cannot enough rules to explain how things work.  Finitism rejects the belief that there can be an ideal language, for example, in which the meaning of statements are entirely determined by a set of self-consistent implicit rules.  It also rejects the notion that a research program could conceiveably determine a sufficiently elaborate set of rules that completely explains how things work.  Both <a href="http://www.california.com/~rathbone/names.htm#Wittgenstein">Wittgenstein </A>and <BR><a href="http://www.california.com/~rathbone/names.htm#Harold Garfinkel">Garfinkel </A>were finitists.  <a href="http://www.california.com/~rathbone/past.htm#Garfinkel and Wittgenstein">PMTH has a series of articles on finitism in Wittgenstein and Garfinkel.</A>
fly-bottle	<a href="http://www.california.com/~rathbone/names.htm#Wittgenstein">Wittgenstein'</A>s term for the confusion that results when one is mystified by language complications.  The terms comes from aphorism 309 of the Philosophical Investigations, in which Wittgenstein says, "309.What is your aim in philosophy? -- To shew the fly the way out of the fly-bottle." The linguistically confused person is the "fly."
foundationalism	The foundationalists are philosophers who argue that we must have certain <a href="bword://apodictic truths">apodictic truths</A> that are self-evident in order for knowledge claims to be deduced from them.
generative metaphor	A term introduced by <A href="http://www.california.com/~rathbone/refer.htm#Schon, Donald 79">Schon.</A>   A generative metaphor is an implicit metaphor that can cast a kind of spell on a community.  All solutions are understood in terms of the implicit metaphor.  &quotUnder the spell of metaphor, it appears obvious that [one thing or another] is bad and [the other] is good." <A href="http://www.california.com/~rathbone/refer.htm#Schon, Donald 79">Schon, p. 255.</A>   If someone can introduce a new generative metaphor, new solutions can be found.
generous listening (or reading)|generous listening|generous reading	<a href="http://www.california.com/~rathbone/names.htm#Lois Shawver">Shawver</A> 's term for one of the things we do to promote <A HREF="bword://paralogy">paralogy</A> . It involves accepting the other person's key terms in their distinctive senses.  Generous listening does not require us to accept the other person's conclusions, but it does require us to be generous in their distinctive use of words.  It is to be distinguished from critical listneing. The concept and the history of this term is detailed in <A href="http://www.california.com/~rathbone/shawver.htm#Shawver-98-uncs">Shawver,1998, Postmodernizing the Unconscious.</A>
gerundic	the turning of a verb into a noun, as drinking becomes a noun in the phrase  "his drinking."  A gerundic switch in culture would take a action and turn it into a thing.  For example, the action homosexual sex becomes a thing when we speak of "homosexuality" or "homosexuals."
grammatology	Derrida's term for the science of <A href="bword://writing">writing (in his sense of &quotwriting").</A>
grand narratives	another name for Lyotard's concept of <a href="bword://meta-narrative">metanarratives</A> .
hegemony	a culture or instituion is a hegemony if it is so dominant that other cultures and institutions do not have a voice.
hermeneutic circle	A concept of Martin Heidegger's that was used by his student Hans-Georg Gadamer, and, finally, incorporated into the therapy theory of <a href="http://www.california.com/~rathbone/names.htm#HarleneAnderson">Harlene Anderson </A>and <a href="http://www.california.com/~rathbone/names.htm#Harold (Harry)">Harry Goolishian</A>.  For Heidegger it meant that one cannot understand the beginning of a text until one has understood the end of the text.  And one did not understand the end of a text until one had read it through from the beginning.  Thus one's study of any text cannot be linear but must be circular. This translates into therapy theory so as to say one's understanding of the client must move back in an interactive dialogic way with the text of what the client says.
hermeneutics	The science of interpretation.
ideology	A set of ideas, doctrines, or beliefs that form the basis of an political or economic system and inspire individuals, groups, classes or cultures.  Sometimes, ideology is understood as creating ideas for certain inspired groups to use as weapons against other groups.
idiom	Lyotard's term for the distinctive local language we develop when the available terms will not work to say what we want to say.  Idioms develop in <a href="bword://borderzone">borderzones</A> .
idioverse	A term introduced by <A href="http://www.california.com/~rathbone/names.htm#Kilian Fritsch">Kilian Fritsch</A> Idioverses are distinguished from &quotuniverses" by their.  The word is used to underscore how particular and distinctive the worlds are that we each live within.
imbricate	overlapping at the edges.  Sometimes this means, making category boundaries more fuzzy
incredulity	disbelief or skepticism.  We are incredulous when we are skeptical or disbelieving.  <A href="http://www.california.com/~rathbone/names.htm#Lyotard">Lyotard</A> made this an important concept for postmodernism by saying that postmoderns are <I>incredulous</I> <BR>of <a href="bword://meta-narrative">metanarratives</A> , that is, they are skeptical about claims that are overgeneralized.
indexical	a term like 'that,' 'this,' 'now,' 'there,' or 'soon.'  That is, a term whose  meaning <BR>is highly dependent on contxt.  These terms present philosophical difficulties. statements incorporating indexicals are true in some circumstances and not in others.  "There is a book on <I>that </I>table," is true or not depending on the table 'that' stands for.  Indexicals are also called 'deictic expressions.'
induction	reasoning based on <A href="bword://inductive logic">inductive logic</A> .
inductive logic	Whereas deductive logic  reasons only with ideas (or premises), induction reasons with observations.  Inductive logic has the general form, &quotI have observed many cases like this in situation A so  I conclude that this is what happens in situation A." Contrast inductive logic with <A href="bword://deductive logic">deductive logic.</A>
inhabit	Bakhtin used this term to talk about the way in which our utterances are based on (or are responses to) others to whom we respond.  So, when someone says, out of the blue, "Life is hard," it can be presumed that this is a response to someone else (who inhabits our utterances) who said this (and the utterance simply affirms it), who denies this (and the denies it), and so forth.
inscribed	in postmodern text this often means that a person has been highly influenced by and accepted a particular notion, norm, or belief.
institutionalization theorem	<a href="http://www.california.com/~rathbone/names.htm#Parsons">Parsons</A> proposal that common value standards will determine and limit what is knowable as fact within an institutional framework.  This institutionalization of values will ensure that objects are viewed within a common                     framework.
intertextuality	The way in which texts reference other texts.
introspection	Reflective consciousness of one's own thoughts and feelings.  (Contrast with extrospection .)  The person who introspects opens up a sense of private <a href="bword://subjectivity">subjectivity</A> .
joint-action	Term introduced by <a href="http://www.california.com/~rathbone/names.htm#Shotter">John Shotter</A> .  It refers to actions we engage in with others so that we are unable to say the extent to which we, personally, caused something to happen or the other(s) caused it to happen.  A teacher tries to teach a child to read, but the child does not learn.  Did the teacher cause this problem?  The child?  Or the parents?  It's a joint action in that we cannot attribute the cause of the situation entirely to one person or <BR>another with any degree of confidence or certainty.
knowing approach	distinguished from the <A HREF="bword://not - knowing">not-knowing</A> approach.  To approach something from a knowing position is to approach it as an expert, as if you know the answers.  To approach it from a not-knowing approach is to approach it as if you did not know the answers.  The knowing approach is typically  <A HREF="bword://modern">modern</A> and the modern therapist typically presents herself as knowing what is good for the client. The postmodern approach is typically <A HREF="bword://not - knowing">not-knowing</A>.
koinonia	Patrick de Mare's term for impersonal fellowship.  <a href="http://www.california.com/~rathbone/bohm.htm#koinonia">Click here to read more.</A>
language game	<a href="http://www.california.com/~rathbone/names.htm#Wittgenstein">Wittgenstein</A> 's term.  The term is used in several related senses.  A primitive language game generally refers to one of Wittgenstein's thought experiments in which we imagine a tribe of people with very minimal and primitive language.  Often the term is used to refer to a somewhat bounded rule-governed sub-segment of ordinary language. Sometimes it is used to refer to the whole of an actual language. <a href="http://www.california.com/~rathbone/word.htm">Click here for a fuller account of the concept of language-game.</A>
law of contradiction	one of three principles required by logical thinking set down by Aristotle.  A thing cannot be both itself and not itself.
law of identity	one of three principles required of logical thinking set down by Aristotle.  A thing is always itself.
law of the excluded middle	one of three principles required by logical thinking set down by Aristotle.  The law of the excluded middle tells us that all statements must be treated as either true or false.  There is no middle ground.  <a href="http://www.encyclopedia.com/printable/07582.html">Click here for more information.</A>
legitimate	<a href="http://www.california.com/~rathbone/names.htm#Lyotard">Lyotard </A> talks about the different ways that various communities lend legitimacy or authority to their statements.  In pre-modern communities narrative is legitimated by people saying that they have heard these stories before.  Science uses its own legitimating method and textual practices. In modernity statements are largely legitimated through cross-referencing. <BR>In postmodernity, Lyotard proposes, that legitimation may occur through the practice of paralogy.  How this works is the subject of his book The Postmodern Condition. <a href="http://www.california.com/~rathbone/constru3.htm#Lyotardlegitimate">(Click here to read more on legitimation in Lyotard.)</A>
listen generously	see "<A href="bword://generous listening">generous listening</A> ".
little narrative	<a href="http://www.california.com/~rathbone/names.htm#Lyotard">Lyotard</A>'s term for a narrative in which key terms are being defined locally and the meaning of these terms is local and provisional.
local meaning	The little narrative of postmodernity involves us in negotiations of local meaning.  This just means we say to each other, "This is what I mean by X" and the other negotiates for the meaning of X.
locus of control	a concept introduced into social learning theory the nineteen-sixties by J.B. Rotter.  People could have either an internal or an external locus of control.  If their locus of control was internal, they would seem themselves as doing things that resulted in things happening s they do.  People with an external locus of control felt themselves to be a pawn of circumstance.
logic	On PMTH, the word &quotlogic" generally refers, not to the colloquial meaning of this term but to the system of formal reasoning introduced by <a href="http://www.california.com/~rathbone/names.htm#Aristotle">Aristole.</A> Aristotle's logic was based on three principles, the <A href="bword://Law of the Excluded Middle">Law of the Excluded Middle,</A> the <A HREF="bword://Law of Contradiction">Law of Contradiction </A> and the <A HREF="bword://Law of Identity">Law of Identity.</A>   In recent times there are symbolic logics which can be more complex.  In Aristotlean, or categorical, logic, a statement can be only true or false, not both at the same time.  In modern logics, there can be alternative valuations of a statement.  In <a href="http://www-pub.cise.ufl.edu/~ddd/cap6635/Fall-97/Short-papers/24.htm">fuzzy logic</A> , we can speak of the proportion of truth in each statement.
logical paradox	A logical paradox consists of a statement  which if true is false and if false is true.  Thus consider &quotI am  lying."  If it is true and I am lying, then I am saying something  false (that is what a lie is) and if it is false and I am saying something  false, then it is true that I am lying.  Such a statement is self-contradictory  It contradicts itself.  Its truth entails its falsity and its falsity entails its truth.
logical positivism	Twentieth-century philosophical movement that is known for its determination to police assertive statements in order to reject as meaningless non-empirical statements that can not be verified. This means that logical positivism rejects all statements of metaphysics, theology, ethics and aesthics as nonsense.  The philosophy is represented by the work of <A href="http://www.california.com/~rathbone/names.htm#Bertrand Russell">Bertrand Russell</A> , (early but not late) <a href="http://www.california.com/~rathbone/names.htm#Wittgenstein">Ludwig Wittgensein</A> , <A href="http://www.california.com/~rathbone/names.htm#Sir Alfred Jules Ayer">A. J. Ayer</A> and the members of the <A HREF="bword://Vienna Circle">Vienna Circle</A> . <a href="http://www.funkandwagnalls.com/encyclopedia/low/articles/bibliography/z032000035f.html">Further references on logical positivism.</A>
logocentrism	A distinctly cultural way of understanding.  <a href="http://www.california.com/~rathbone/names.htm#Derrida">Derrida </A> uses this term frequently to refer to the western cultural way of understanding that, he argues, was instituted by Plato  Western logocentrism  privileges language over nonverbal communication.  <a href="http://www.aber.ac.uk/~dgc/litoral4.html">Click here to see more., </A> and it privileges speech over witing with a <A HREF="bword://metaphysics of presence">metaphysics of presence</A> .  <A HREF="bword://Deconstruction">Deconstruction </A> exposes the way in which we must have both sides of the dichotomy (such as writing and speech, or male and female) in order to have the privileged side.
marginalize	to leave out of the center of the text and (metaphorically) to put in the margin.  Minority voices are often marginalized in this way.  But the term can also be used more broadly to include the voices of people who are to shy or insecure to bring their concerns to center stage.  Often this term is used in the phrase <A HREF="bword://marginalized voices">marginalized voices</A>.
marginalized voices	people whose words are not given much weight.  See <A HREF="bword://marginalize">marginalize</A>
meritocracy	a value which privileges the hardworking over the less driven.
meta-narrative	<a href="http://www.california.com/~rathbone/names.htm#Lyotard">Lyotard</A> 's term.  It means a story or narrative that is presumed to have great generality and represents a final and <a href="bword://apodictic truths">apodictic</A> truth. <a href="bword://Modern">Modernists</A> , Lyotard  tells us, believe in metanarratives whereas postmoderns are incredulous of metanarratives.  Postmoderns, in this sense of the term, are eclectic and gather their beliefs from a variety of sources while treating the resulting compilation as tentative.
metaphysics of presence	the belief that the thoughts we have in the present are more real than the thoughts that we read that were <a href="bword://writing">written</A> elsewhere and in the past.  The metaphysics of presence tells us that if I have this thought and write it down, it is forever mine.
mftc-l	mftc is a listserv.  The pmth listserv was initiated late in 1998 when a schism occurred on the mftc list.  The causes of that schism are complex, but pmth became a list for more scholarly and philosophical discussion while many members continued on both lists.
modern	Also called &quotmodernist." In the context of a <A HREF="bword://postmodern">postmodern </A> vocabulary, the &quotmodern" does not mean &quotcontemporary."  In fact, the &quotmodern" or &quotmodernism" is seen as out-of-date. The &quotmodern" is understood to have emerged during the 18th century Enlightenmentwhen philosphers were challenging superstitions (which often included religion) of premodern beliefs.  They replaced faith in superstition with faith that science and objectivity could build us a better world.  Moderns prefer objective and factual language.  &quotModern" therapies (as postmoderns use the term) are therapies that pretend to be scientific when they are not by using scientific sounding terms are methods.
monologic	like a monologue.  An essay is monologic if it does not bring in other views.  Monologic is contrasted with <a href="bword://dialogic">dialogic</A> .
myth of physical objects	<a href="http://www.california.com/~rathbone/names.htm#W. V. O. Quine">Quine</A>
naive realism	the view that we can know things in the world directly without taking into account our uncertainties and doubts.<BR>
naturalistic fallacy	reasoning from what is the case to what should be the case.
negative capability	a term of the poet John Keats.  It means the ability to live well within he mystery and ambiguity of the world around us.  <a href="http://www.qeliz.ac.uk/English/Keats.htm">See</A>
not-knowing	<a href="http://www.california.com/~rathbone/names.htm#Harold (Harry)">Harry Goolishian </A>and <a href="http://www.california.com/~rathbone/names.htm#HarleneAnderson">Harlene Anderson</A>'s term for the recommended approach that therapists should have towards their clients.  In this approach therapists avoid taking dogmatic postures and try to remain flexible to have their perspectives altered by their clients.  <a href="http://www.california.com/~rathbone/pmthold.htm#not knowing">(click here for more on not-knowing.)</A> <a href="http://www.california.com/~rathbone/names.htm#FredNewman">Fred Newman </A>and <a href="http://www.california.com/~rathbone/names.htm#Lois Holzman">Lois Holzman </A>talk about something quite similar when they speak about the "end of knowing."
oedipal complex	a sequence of development experiences that Freud argued all human boys went through.  It involves the boys romantic feelings for his mother.  However, in Freud's theory, if the oedipal ocmplex is "properly" resolved, the boy gives up his quest for his mother's romantic affections.  Supposedly this happens because he believes, unconsciously and symbolically at least, that he will otherwise lose his penis (be castrated.)
ontology	the philosophy of Being, that is, the study of the metaphysical foundations of the universe. <BR><a href="http://wings.buffalo.edu/philosophy/ontology/">click here for a link on ontology</A>
operational definition	a concrete and procedural definition of something that is otherwise difficult to agree about.  For example, people can disagree about how creative a particular person is. After all, people are creative in different ways and what one person would consider "creative" another person might consider "off the wall."  But an operational definition removes the challenge of differing opinions and ties the definition to a procedure that is precise and, for those using the operational definition, not contestable.  A set of questions might be used to "operationally define" creativity, for example so that every time someone answered a question "yes" they were given a point.  Their operationally defined creativity might be the sum of all their points -- even if the questions have nothing to do with what you and I ordinarily think of "creativity."  Questions about whether the operational definition measures what it says it measures are questions about the "validity" of an operational definition.  One can have an operational definition without it being "valid."
ostensive definition	To define something by pointing to something named.  For example, if someone were to say, "What's a baboon?" one might point to one (or to a picture of one, and say "That's a baboon."  <a href="http://www.california.com/~rathbone/names.htm#Wittgenstein">Wittgenstein </A>organizes much of his thinking around the concept of an ostensive definition.  Our culture says that ostensive definitions are the major way that children learn language. Wittgenstein's first section of his book, The Philosophical Investigations, shows us why this is an insufficient answer.
pagan	<a href="http://www.california.com/~rathbone/names.htm#Lyotard">Lyotard</A>'s term.  It means to judge without criteria.  <a href="http://www.california.com/~rathbone/names.htm#Lois Shawver">Lois Shawver </A>interprets this to mean "judged on the basis of a felt sense of good and bad without being able to put this in words."  On Shawver's interpretation, it might be possible to discern the rules being used in a particular pagan judgment. <p>Be careful to distinguish this <A HREF="bword://postmodern">postmodern </A>meaning of the term from both the historical one which means  'non-Christian',  as well as the contemporary meaning of western (neo)Paganism, especially <a href="http://www.angelfire.com/wi/nightstorm/page10.html">Wicca</A>.
pagan voice	The pagan voice is the heartfelt voice that expressesan opinion that goes beyond the evidence, beyond the rules, beyond the critiera.
pagan yelp	a term introduced by <A href="http://www.california.com/~rathbone/names.htm#Joe Pfeffer">Joe Pfeffer.</A>   The pagan yelp is a kind of  &quotouch" reflex when something seems unfair or hurtful.  It is a yelp because it is not a judgment based on rules, simply an expression of the heart.
pagus	see <A href="bword://borderzone">&quotborderzone."</A>
paralogy	a stimulating conversation that generates ideas without necessarily resulting in consensus.  These new ideas emerge, in large part, because paralogy allows us to define the rules of language terms locally and provisionally.  That is, in a local conversation we might say, &quotI am using the word in this sense."   (Of course, there are many terms that will not be defined locally even in a paralogical conversation.)  This is <a href="http://www.california.com/~rathbone/names.htm#Lyotard">Lyotard</A> 's term; however, Lyotard conceived of paralogy involving <A href="bword://agonistics">agonistics,</A> and after much conversation on this topic in PMTH, most feel that it can and does take place without agonistics, or at least without aggressive agonistics.  Most people on PMTH look for a different metaphor or <A HREF="bword://social poetics">social poetics</A> to describe the way in which one comment links to another in paralogy.
paramodern	A term introduced by <A href="http://www.california.com/~rathbone/names.htm#Larner, Glenn">Glenn Larner.</A>   It means to identify the position in which the author speaks but holds his position lightly, knowing that it can be deconstructed.
pathologize	to take some way of reacting, feeling, or being and to treat it as a disease.  For example, homosexuality was for centuries thought to be an "unethical" action in the western world and then in the early part of the twentieth century it was "pathologized" and treated as a form of <I>mental illness</I>.
patterned jello	what the moderate realist, <a href="http://www.california.com/~rathbone/names.htm#David Pocock">David Pocock</A>,  says is beyond language, or pre-language.
performative utterance	a statement that, in being made, produces a change in the way things are no matter what the response to it.  For example, when someone says, &quotI promise you that I will do X" then results in a changed obligation regardless of whether that person actually does X.  This concept was introduced in philosophy by J. L. Austin.
phenomenology	The study of conscious experience.
picture theory of language	a theory of early Wittgenstein (as written about in the Tractatus.)  The theory says that all objects are either simple (without parts) or made up of simples.  Language represents the relationship of these simples to each other as a kind of picture, and the atoms of the picture correspond to elements in the world that are pictured.  (See the Investigations.) <a href="http://www.tcd.ie/Psychology/People/Ruth_Byrne/mental_models/intro.html">Click here </A>here to look into the relationship between the picture theory of language and artificial intelligence research.
play	On p.289 of Structure, Sign and Play, <A href="http://www.california.com/~rathbone/names.htm#Derrida">Derrida</A> says that &quotplay" is the infinite substitute of meanings. Every term, every phrase,has a certain range of meanings and these substitute for each other indifferent contexts. That is the &quotplay" of language.
posit	(as in &quotde-posit)  To posit is to put presume the existence of or to to suggest the existence of for consideration and study as if it were it were in fact existing, or to pretend that something exists without question as if it were an <A href="bword://apodictic truths">apodictic truth.</A>
positive connotation	qualifying all behavior, even symptoms, as somehow beneficial to the family.  This was a therapy technique at the Milan center in <a href="http://www.familytherapynetwork.com/atn.html">Milan Italy</A> .
positivism	the form of positivism that is most relevant to postmodernism is the positivism of the early twentieth century which is often called &quotlogical positivism" but also includes other branches of positivism. A positivist theory is one that defines its terms precisely and tries to invent ways to talk and think that don't get lost in obscurities in the hopes of discovering a more powerful and accurate language calculus.  Traditional social science research, with random samples, operationally defined variables, and statistical analysis, is positivist.   Early <A href="http://www.california.com/~rathbone/names.htm#Wittgenstein">Wittgenstein</A> was a positivist.  Later Wittgenstein was a postpositivist.
post-foundationalism	philosophers who reject <A HREF="bword://foundationalism">foundationalism</A>.
postmodern	Alas, there are a two similar but critically different meanings of the term become confused.  Most people want to say, however, that postmodernism originated in the middle of the twentieth century and was a rejection of the "<A HREF="bword://modern">modern</A> " or &quotmodernism.". <BR>The most prominent one, however, is probably Jean-Francois <a href="http://www.california.com/~rathbone/names.htm#Lyotard">Lyotard</A> 's definition of postmodernism as an incredulity towards <A href="bword://meta - narrative">meta-narratives</A> . This means the postmodern is one who is skeptical of  theories that speak in grand generalities and that universalize their conclusions. Translated into therapy theory this often means that the therapist works to <BR>avoid dogmatic posturing about the &quotTruth" of the client's situation.  In discussion forums this may mean that the quest is not for consensus around some grand statement of the truth but for <A HREF="bword://paralogy">paralogy</A> .&nbspThis kind of postmodernism tends to be utopian and visionary, imagining that postmodernism can bring us better lives. <BR>On the other hand, postmodern sometimes means disillusionment with the standard way of understanding things.  In this case, the therapist tries to offer a more correct (or helpful?) way of thinking and these helpful ways tend to be counter-intuitive for mainstream cultural thinking. In this case, therapists often talk about the dominant or oppressive narrative and offer, in its stead, a preferred narrative.&nbspSome disillusioned postmoderns, however, are nostalgic, feeling even that the loss of the metanarrative devastates mental health and that we should fight <BR>postmodernism in order to to make it a better world. <BR>There is, therefore, an ongoing controversy about postmodernism that revolves partly around different definitions of the term.
postpositivism	is a philosophy that rejects the project of positivism (to clean up language to make it more logically tight).  Postpositivism remains powerfully influenced by positivism, however, in that it sees langauge as highly important.  Neverthless, it studies language as it is and does not engage in the project of making it more logically tight.
poststructruralism	a school of thought that critiques <a href="bword://structuralism">structuralist</A> thinking, generally with <A HREF="bword://deconstruction">deconstruction</A> . <A href="http://www.california.com/~rathbone/names.htm#Derrida">Derrida</A> is a key poststructuralist thinker.
praxis	the practical or customary application of a branch of learning.
premodern	The premodern is what came before <a href="bword://modern">modernism.</A>   The premodern is one who has unquestioning faith in a revealed truth, a religious truth, a superstitious truth or a truth passed along by word of mouth.
putting [something] under erasure|putting under erasure	This is <A href="http://www.california.com/~rathbone/names.htm#Derrida">Derrida</A> 's term.  It means presenting our ideas as though they were undeconstructable but with awareness that they can be deconstructed.  One might say, &quotI say [such and such], but I am putting it under erasure."  One might also speak of &quotkeeping [something] under erasure," or ask if something is &quotunder erasure" and so forth..
queer	in the nineteen-fifties, the term "queer" was a slur, a term of condemnation for people identified as homosexual.  Today, the term  usually represents stance towards homosexuality that does not fix it within a particular gender identity.  A "queer" is a person who, at least in theory, is willing to be lovers with either men or women.
queer theory	theorizes that gender and sexual identities are not fixed.  <a href="http://www.california.com/~rathbone/names.htm#Judith Butler">See Butler.</A> <BR><a href="http://www.leeds.ac.uk/ics/ctr-que1.htm">See more on queer theory.</A>
reading generously	this is analogous to <A href="bword://generous listening">listening generously</A> .  A generous reading tries to make the most sense possible out of what is being read. It is to be distinguished from critical reading.
realism	traditional realism is the doctrine that Platonic universals or forms exist independently of language or human thought.  That is, there is a correct way to divide the world up into its many objects and this way conforms to the underlying real structure.  Socrates famous explanation of this imagery is that the philosopher who sets up a correct taxonomy carves the chicken at the joints and then our concepts reflect the structure of the world independent of our minds. In this version of realism, somehow the forms of things exist apart from the objects that conform to those forms.   In more recent version of realism argues that the things we perceive exist apart from our mental representation of them -- so, for example, the tree that fell in the forest with no one around would, according to this view, make a sound, even though no one could hear it.  But notice, this recent sense of 'realism' falls short of addressing questions about the structure of the world and how it falls into its inherent categories, but that is the question addressed by traditional realism.
receptive voice	the receptive voice is a way of talking that helps us listen.  It asks questions, offers paraphrases that reflect <A HREF="bword://generous listening">generous listening </A>and works to clarify and make sense of phrases that seem unclear or unconvincing on first hearing.  The receptive voice can be opposed to the <A HREF="bword://pagan voice">pagan voice.</A>
recursive	A statement such as "This sentence is written in English"  is a recursion in that the sentence refers to itself to make its point, or achieve its intended purpose, demonstrates <I>recursion </I>or is <I>recursive.</I>  (See <A HREF="bword://recursive paradox">recursive paradox</A>.)
recursive paradox	a recursive statement is paradoxical when it refers to itself in such a way that it cannot possibly be true.  For example, "This statement is false" is a recursive paradox.
reductionism	The belief that some identifiable kind of statements can be replaced systematically by statements or expressions of a simpler or  more certain kind. For example, some philosophers have held that arithmetic can be reduced to logic, that the mental can be reduced to the physical, or that the life sciences can be reduced to the physical sciences.
reflexivity	<a href="http://www.california.com/~rathbone/names.htm#Parsons">Parsons' </A>term. Actors with a reflexive attitude tend to be self-aware. of their own motivations. However, according to <a href="http://www.california.com/~rathbone/names.htm#JonathanPotter">Potter</A>, reflexivity for <a href="http://www.california.com/~rathbone/names.htm#Harold Garfinkel">Garfinkel </A>means the way in which description enters into the constitution of what is being described.  "In stressing the reflexive nature of discourse, ethnomethodologists are attempting to under- mine the commonly assumed dualism between a description and what is being described" <a href="http://www.california.com/~rathbone/refer.htm#Potter,">(Potter, 1996, p.47)</A>. <a href="http://www.sosig.ac.uk/roads/cgi/tempbyhand.pl?query=885899854-11320&database=SOSIG">To be reflexive, in terms of a work of anthropology</A>, is to insist that anthropologists systematically and rigorously reveal their methodology and themselves as the instrument of data generation.
regime	a prevailing social system, or pattern, or form of government.
reification	to treat an abstract or metaphorical concept as if it were an underlying stable unit of reality, for example to treat love-sickness as a disease or to treat the abstract concept of "color" as something existing apart from any colored object.
reify	to treat an abstraction or a metaphor as if it was something concrete, something with size and location.
relational perspective	a term which is coming to mean "those philosophies that put the relationship of the participants over and above the validity of the content of their mutual contributions to the discussion."  Thus, from a relational perspective, the point of the conversation is not to discover truth, but to create a relationship in which the conversation can continue to the satisfaction of the participants.
relativism	theories that values don't exist except in relationship to the mind of an individual who values them, or a culture that values them.
representation	or a representation theory of meaning.  According to this philosophy language puts facts in words and, if the worded statements are true, corresponds to states of affairs.
revisionist historians	historians who revise an accepted historical accounts. <a href="http://www.abbc.com/aaargh/engl/FaurisArch/whoisRF.html">Robert Faurisson</A>   is an example of a revisionist historian.
rhizome	a horizontal and usually underground stem that sends out roots and shoots that look like independent plants but have the same root system.  Deleuze uses rhizome as a metaphor for contextual and often pragmatic modification of an activity that stems from the same root structure.  It means that the activity, or the people, are connected but without pregiven rules, connections that cannot be foreseen.
ruse	A word that <A href="http://www.california.com/~rathbone/names.htm#Lyotard">Lyotard</A> uses to talk about the language moves that people make in <a href="bword://paralogy">paralogical</A> conversations. There has been some deliberation on PMTH as to whether this term carries unfortunate connotation that such moves must be deceptive.  Several alternative terms have been suggested including &quotdevice," &quotstrategy," &quotplan," and "<A HREF="bword://tack">tack</A> ."
seeing as	In the long aphorism xi of the second book of <A href="http://www.california.com/~rathbone/names.htm#Wittgenstein">Wittgenstein</A> 's <a href="http://www.california.com/~rathbone/refer.htm#Wittgenstein-63">Philosophical Investigation</A> s Wittgenstein makes a distinction between &quotseeing" and &quotseeing as".  To &quotsee as" is something one learns to do.  It is based on a technique that one masters.  One might look at a map, say, without recognizing it for what it is.  But with a bit of training one learns to see the map differently and to use it as a guide around the city.  Before one does that, one has to learn to see as, that is to see the scriggly lines as streets.
semiology	a term introduced by Ferdinand de <A href="http://www.california.com/~rathbone/names.htm#Ferdinand de Saussure">Saussure.</A>   Semiology would be a science that shows what causes signs (words-concepts)  to emerge.  Today this is usually referred to as &quotsemiotics".  Key figures in semiotics include Charles Sanders Pierce, Roland Barthes, and Julia Krestiva.  Levi-Strauss and Jacques Lacan also were concerned with semiotics.  Modern semiotic theory is also sometimes associated with Marxism.
sign	a term introduced by the classic linguist Saussure. A sign is composed of a <A HREF="bword://signified">signified </A>and a <A HREF="bword://signifier">signifier</A>.  For example, a signifier like "table" represents the concept of a table (not the object -table).
signified	what is represented by the <A HREF="bword://signifier">signifier</A>.  Signified and signifier combine to create a "<A HREF="bword://sign">sign</A>."
signifier	the token that represents a <A HREF="bword://signified">signified</A>.  Signified and signifier combine to create a "<A HREF="bword://sign">sign</A>."
social constructionism	Some postmodern authors (<a href="http://www.california.com/~rathbone/names.htm#Kenneth">Gergen</A> , <a href="http://www.california.com/~rathbone/names.htm#Shotter">Shotter</A> , <a href="http://www.california.com/~rathbone/names.htm#HarleneAnderson">Anderson</A> and <a href="http://www.california.com/~rathbone/names.htm#Harold (Harry)">Goolishian</A> ) think it is important to distinguish social constructionism from constructivism.  Others do not.  If the distinction is maintained, social constructionism (or simply &quotconstructionism") is seen to be the study of the social processes (or language processes) we use to create and maintain our beliefs in ordinary concepts such as mental illness, marriage, the difference between men and women.
social poetics	the study and use of metaphor and other figures of speech occurring in ordinary speech and prose.  The term is introduced by <a href="http://www.california.com/~rathbone/names.htm#Shotter">John Shotter</A> and his sometimes co-author Arlene Katz.  See a <a href="http://www.california.com/~rathbone/refer.htm#Katz, Arlene M.; Shotter 96">related article by Katz and Shotter</A> , <a href="http://www.massey.ac.nz/~ALock/virtual/sacksdrp.htm">an article by John Shotter, </A> and still <a href="http://www.massey.ac.nz/~ALock/virtual/poetics.htm">another article by Shotter on this topic</A>
social therapy	The kind of therapy done by the <a href="http://www.california.com/~rathbone/names.htm#FredNewman">Newman </A> and <a href="http://www.california.com/~rathbone/names.htm#Lois Holzman">Holzman</A> 's developmental centers.  "[T]he effort in the social therapy group is to transform...the actual conversation into a language-game (a performed conversation) by stripping the conversation of its truth referentiality, not by changing what is said -- having people say different things -- but by changing the truth and referential assumption of what is being said." <I>(<a href="http://www.california.com/~rathbone/names.htm#FredNewman">Newman</A></I> <I> &amp; <a href="http://www.california.com/~rathbone/names.htm#Lois Holzman">Holzman</A></I> <I>, <a href="http://www.california.com/~rathbone/refer.htm#Newman-97">The End of Knowing,Routledge, 1997, p.117</A></I> <I>).</I>
solipsism	The view that all we know is our own consciousness and we cannot be sure that anything exists outside of our own minds.  In other words, we might be just imagining that each other, the chairs we sit in, the tea we drink, is real.
sophist	Today a sophist is someone who reasons illegitimately.  It is a term of condemnation.  But the term originally referred to a group of thinkers and tutors in ancient Greece that <A href="http://www.california.com/~rathbone/names.htm#Plato">Plato</A> , Socrates and Aristotle condemned. <a href="http://www.california.com/~rathbone/refer.htm#Kerferd, 1981- the sophistic movement">Kerford</A> , an important historian of the sophistic movement says, &quotfor much of our information we are dependent upon Plato's profoundly hostile treatment of them, presented with all the power of his literary genius and driven home with a philosophical impact that is little short of overwhelming." (p.1)
structural coupling	<A href="http://www.california.com/~rathbone/names.htm#Humberto Maturana">Maturana</A> 's and <A href="http://www.california.com/~rathbone/names.htm#Francisco Varela">Varela</A> '.  Structural coupling is the coming together of two <a href="bword://autopoetic unity">autopoietic unities</A> on a recurrent basis and in a way that alters their structure.
structuralism	The term is used differently in different circles, but in the postmodern circle it generally refers to the theories influenced by <A href="http://www.california.com/~rathbone/names.htm#Ferdinand de Saussure">Saussure</A> .  According to these schools of thought, learning a particular langauge lays down a firm and resistant way of understanding.  Structuralism studies these resistant ways of understanding.
stubbornness	In a recent unpublished paper <A href="http://www.california.com/~rathbone/names.htm#Richard_Rorty">Rorty</A> hypothesized that the stubbornness shown by <A href="http://www.california.com/~rathbone/names.htm#Spinoza,">Spinoza</A> and <A href="http://www.california.com/~rathbone/names.htm#Socrates_-">Socrates</A> , along with their  <A HREF="bword://conversability">conversability</A> , might be the reason that we are inclined to see them as wise.

syllogism	a model of reasoning introduced by Aristole.  The usual example is: <BR>    All men are moral <BR>    Socrates was a man <BR>    Therefore, Socrates was moral.
systemic theory	suggests that changes in individuals and groups can only be understood in the context of the multiple systems (e.g., family, work, school, church) in which they occur.  Moreover, whenever we conceptualize the problem as occurring with a given context, we are likely overlooking a larger context which would help to explain it better.
tempered pagan voice	The tempered pagan voice expresses a heart felt point of view (as does any <A HREF="bword://pagan voice">pagan voice</A>) but frames the expression in ways that respect the listener.
totalize	to generalize so grandly as to make room for no exceptions.
transference	Feelings that the <A HREF="bword://analysand">analysand </A> has for the psychoanalyst that reflect the analysand's personal history more than they are a reaction to the behavior or character of the psychoanalyst.
transvaluation	a reframing that changes the value perspective.  A term <a href="http://www.california.com/~rathbone/names.htm#Lois Shawver">Lois Shawver</A> <BR>borrowed from Nietzsche.
two voices	a local PMTH phrase.  A person speaks with two voices if she says what she thinks but also makes space for the other person to say what she thinks, either by asking questions, or by showing receptivity in some other way.  Jerry Shaffer labeled these voices an "assertive voice" and a "receptive voice."
typifying	<a href="http://www.california.com/~rathbone/names.htm#Alfred Schutz">Schutz</A>'s term.  Scultz says langauge is <I>typifying </I>because although every state <BR>of affairs is unique, this fact is not reflected in our vocabulary.
under erasure	(or &quoterasure" or &quotputting [something] under erasure" ).  This is <A href="http://www.california.com/~rathbone/names.htm#Derrida">Derrida</A> 's term.  It means presenting our ideas as though they were undeconstructable but with awareness that they can be deconstructed. One might say, &quotI say [such and such], but I am putting it under erasure." One might also speak of &quotkeeping [something] under erasure," or ask if something is &quotunder erasure" and so forth..
underdetermined	rival hypotheses to explain the facts are "underdetermined" when they are equally consistent with the available evidence.  There is a question if every scientific theory must always remain underdetermined.
unique outcomes	A term introduced by <A href="http://www.california.com/~rathbone/names.htm#David Epston">Epston</A> and <A href="http://www.california.com/~rathbone/names.htm#MichaelWhite">White</A>
utterance	Bakhtin's term for his unit of language analysis.  An utterance is dialogic.  Its meaning hinges on its relationship with other utterances and on the subject to whom it is addressed.  Each utterance is a response to a prior utterance, refuting it, affirming it, supplementing it, etc.  In this way our &quotutterances" are inhabited by the voices of others, that is, by those to whom we respond.
validity of operational definition	tells us if the operational test measures what it was intended to measure.(<a href="http://www.sfb504.uni-mannheim.de/glossary/validity.htm">click here)</A>.  There are many different ways that researchers attempt to establish "validity."  The simplest of these is "face validity."  The most meaningful is probably "construct validity."
will to power	<A href="http://www.california.com/~rathbone/names.htm#Nietzsche">Nietzsche's</A> term.  It means determination to construct the world and the things in it as one desires it to be.
writing	<A href="http://www.california.com/~rathbone/names.htm#Derrida">Derrida</A> 's term for any human production that stays around after the &quotauthor" has left to continue to influence the way in which we think or act even though we cannot interact with the author about the written work.  See, especially, <I>Of Grammatology</I>, p. 11.
zone of proximal development (or "zpd")|zone of proximal development|zpd	<a href="http://www.california.com/~rathbone/names.htm#Vygotsky">Vygotsky</A> 's term for an environment that supports learning.  In the zpd of infancy, for example, adults speak to the child before the child is able to understand saying things like, &quotIt's chilly here.  That's why we have to bundle up," even though the infant is not yet know these phrases.  Neverthless, hearing things <BR>like this over and over assists the development of the child's ability to speak.
