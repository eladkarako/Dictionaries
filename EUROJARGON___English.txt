##description	A plain language guide to Eurojargon: People in the EU institutions and in the media dealing with EU affairs are in the bad habit of using words and expressions that they alone understand. We call these words and expressions �eurojargon�. Because outsiders cannot understand it, eurojargon is very unhelpful to ordinary people, and the EU institutions are trying to avoid using it in information for the general public. In the meantime, this �plain language guide� may help you.

Absorption capacity|Absorptive capacity	Absorption (absorptive) capacity<br>\nThis usually means the ability of a country or organization to receive aid and use it effectively. Developing countries often lack this capacity. For example, a country may receive enough money to enable all its children to attend primary school - but owing to a lack of teachers, lack of schools or a poor administrative system, it is impossible to spend this money in the short term. Work must first be done to train teachers, build schools and improve the efficiency of the system - thus raising the country's ''absorptive capacity''.
Acceding - country|Acceding country	this is a <A href="bword://candidate country">candidate country</A> that has met the <A href="bword://Copenhagen criteria">Copenhagen criteria</A> and has completed negotiations for joining the European Union.
Acquis communautaire	This is a French term meaning, essentially, "the EU as it is" - in other words, the rights and obligations that EU countries share. The "acquis" includes all the EU's treaties and laws, declarations and resolutions, international agreements on EU affairs and the judgments given by the Court of Justice. It also includes action that EU governments take together in the area of "justice and home affairs" and on the Common Foreign and Security Policy. "Accepting the acquis" therefore means taking the EU as you find it. Candidate countries have to accept the "acquis" before they can join the EU, and make EU law part of their own national legislation. For a fuller explanation, see ''<A href="http://europa.eu.int/scadplus/leg/en/cig/g4000.htm">Community acquis</A>'' in the glossary.
Agenda	This term literally means "things to be done". It normally refers to the list of items for discussion at a meeting, but politicians also use it as a jargon term meaning "things we want to achieve". For example, "<B>Agenda 2000</B>" was the title of a package of proposals to reform the Common Agricultural Policy (see: ''<A href="bword://CAP reform">CAP reform</A>'') and to plan the EU's budget for 2000-2006. Anti-trust The EU aims to guarantee fair and free competition in the single market, and to ensure that companies compete rather than collude. So EU rules prohibit agreements that restrict competition (e.g. secret agreements between companies to charge artificially high prices) and abuses by firms who hold a dominant position on the market. Rules of this kind are known as "anti-trust" legislation. The Commission has considerable powers to prohibit anti-competitive activities, and to impose fines on firms found guilty of anti-competitive conduct.
Applicant country	This means a country that has applied to join the European Union. Once its application has been officially accepted, it becomes a <A href="bword://candidate country">candidate country</A>.<BR>For further details see <A href="http://europa.eu.int/scadplus/leg/en/cig/g4000.htm"> glossary</A>.
Benchmarking	This means measuring how well one country, business, industry, etc. is performing compared to other countries, businesses, industries, and so on. The ''benchmark'' is the standard by which performance will be judged. Benchmarking is one of the techniques used in the ''Lisbon process''.
Brussels has decided	"Brussels has decided..."<br>\nThe term "Brussels" is often used in the media to refer to the EU institutions, most of which are located in the city of Brussels. EU laws are proposed by the European Commission but it is the Council of the European Union (ministers from the national governments) and the European Parliament (elected by the European citizens) that debate, amend and ultimately decide whether to pass these proposed laws.
CAP reform	The Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) was first introduced in 1960, to ensure that Europe had secure food supplies at affordable prices. But it became a victim of its own success, generating unwanted surpluses of some products such as beef, barley, milk and wine. Also, the subsidies paid to European farmers were distorting world trade. So the European Commission began reviewing the CAP in 1999. The EU agreed further reforms in 2003, with the emphasis on high-quality farm produce and animal-friendly farming practices that respect the environment and preserve the countryside. The EU plans to cut back on direct subsidies to farmers, so as to redress the balance between EU agricultural markets and those of the developing world.
Candidate country	This means a country that has applied to join the European Union and whose application has been officially accepted. Before a candidate country can join the EU it must meet the ''<A href="bword://Copenhagen criteria">Copenhagen criteria</A>.''
Civil society	This is the collective name for all kinds of organizations and associations that are not part of government but that represent professions, interest groups or sections of society. It includes (for example) trade unions, employers' associations, environmental lobbies and groups representing women, farmers, people with disabilities and so on. Since these organizations have a lot of expertise in particular areas and are involved in implementing and monitoring European Union policies, the EU regularly consults civil society and wants it to become more involved in European policymaking.
Comitology	This is more correctly known as "committee procedure". It describes a process in which the Commission, when implementing EU law, has to consult special advisory committees made up of experts from the EU countries. For a fuller explanation, go to "<A href="http://europa.eu.int/scadplus/leg/en/cig/g4000.htm">glossary</A>''.
Common market	When the <A href="bword://EEC">EEC</A> was founded in 1957, it was based on a ''common market''. In other words, people, goods and services should be able to move around freely between the member states as if they were all one country, with no checks carried out at the borders and no customs duties paid. However, this took a while to achieve: customs duties between the EEC countries were not completely abolished until 1 July 1968. Other barriers to trade also took a long while to remove, and it was not until the end of 1992 that the ''Single Market'' (as it became known) was in place.
Community bridge	This is a procedure for transferring certain matters from the third ''pillar'' of the EU to the first ''pillar'' so that they can be dealt with using the Community method. Any decision to use the bridge has to be taken by the Council, unanimously, and then ratified by each Member State.
Community method	This is the EU's usual method of decision-making, in which the Commission makes a proposal to the Council and Parliament who then debate it, propose amendments and eventually adopt it as EU law. In the process, they will often consult other bodies such as the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions.
Competencies	This is eurojargon for "powers and responsibilities". It is often used in political discussions about what powers and responsibilities should be given to EU institutions and what should be left to national, regional and local authorities.
Constitution of the EU	At present, the EU is founded on four basic treaties that lay down the rules by which it has to operate. These treaties are big and complex, and EU leaders would like to replace them with a single, shorter, simpler document spelling out the EU's purposes and aims and stating clearly who does what. This new document (technically known as the "constitutional Treaty") will be rather similar to the constitution of a country - even though the EU is not, and does not aim to be, a single country. A proposal for this EU Constitution was drawn up in 2003 by the <A href="bword://Convention on the future of Europe">Convention on the future of Europe</A>, but the text has yet to be agreed by EU leaders.
Convention	This term has various meanings, including (in the EU context) a group of people representing the EU institutions, the national governments and parliaments, who come together to draw up an important document. Conventions of this sort met to draw up the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and the draft EU Constitution (see <B> <A href="bword://Convention on the Future of Europe">Convention on the Future of Europe</A></B>).
Convention on the future of Europe	The European Convention (also known as the Convention on the future of Europe) was set up in December 2001. It had 105 members, representing the presidents or prime ministers of the EU member states and candidate countries, their national parliaments, the European Parliament and the European Commission. Its Chairman was former French President Val?ry Giscard d'Estaing. The Convention's job was to draw up a new Treaty that would set out clear rules for running the European Union after enlargement. It was, in effect, to be the <A href="bword://Constitution of the EU">Constitution of the EU</A> .<BR>The Convention completed its work on 10 July 2003. For further information see the <A href="http://european-convention.eu.int/bienvenue.asp?lang=EN"> Convention's website</A>.
Copenhagen criteria	In June 1993, EU leaders meeting in Copenhagen set three criteria that any <A href="bword://candidate country">candidate country</A> must meet before it can join the European Union. First, it must have stable institutions guaranteeing democracy, the rule of law, human rights and respect for minorities. Second, it must have a functioning market economy. Third, it must take on board all the <A href="bword://Acquis communautaire">acquis</A> and support the various aims of the European Union. The EU reserves the right to decide when a candidate country has met these criteria and when the EU is ready to accept the new member.
Council	There are three different European bodies with the word "council" in their names: <BR><BR><B>The European Council</B> <BR>This is the meeting of heads of State and government (i.e. presidents and/or prime ministers) of all the EU countries, plus the President of the European Commission. The European Council meets, in principle, four times a year to agree overall EU policy and to review progress. It is the highest-level policy-making body in the European Union, which is why its meetings are often called "summits". <BR><BR><B>The Council of the European Union</B> <BR>Formerly known as the Council of Ministers, this institution consists of government ministers from all the EU countries. The Council meets regularly to take detailed decisions and to pass European laws. <BR><BR><B>The Council of Europe</B><BR>This is not an EU institution. It is an intergovernmental organization based in Strasbourg and it aims (amongst other things) to protect human rights, to promote Europe's cultural diversity and to combat social problems such as xenophobia and intolerance. The Council of Europe was set up in 1949 and one of its early achievements was to draw up the European Convention on Human Rights. To enable citizens to exercise their rights under that Convention it set up the European Court of Human Rights.
Cultural capitals	Every year a number of European cities are designated as "cultural capitals". The aim is to publicise and celebrate the cultural achievements and charms of these cities and so make European citizens more aware of the rich heritage they share. Genoa and Lille have been chosen as European capitals of culture for 2004. Further information is available at <A href="http://www.genova-2004.it"><B>www.genova-2004.it</B></A> and at <A href="http://www.lille2004.fr"> <B>www.lille2004.fr</B></A>.
DG	The staff of the main EU institutions (Commission, Council and Parliament) are organized into a number of distinct departments, known as "Directorates-General" (DGs), each of which is responsible for specific tasks or policy areas. The administrative head of a DG is known as the "Director-General" (a term sometimes also abbreviated to "DG").
Democratic deficit	It is often said that the EU's decision-making system is too remote from ordinary people, who cannot understand its complexities and its difficult legal texts. The EU is trying to overcome this "democratic deficit" through simpler legislation and better public information, and by giving <A href="bword://civil society">civil society</A> a greater say in European policymaking. Citizens are already represented in EU decision-making via the European Parliament. For further details go to "<A href="http://europa.eu.int/scadplus/leg/en/cig/g4000.htm">glossary</A>".
EC	This acronym refers either to the "European Community" or to the "European Commission". <BR><BR><B> The European Community</B> <BR>is the present name for what was originally called the "European Economic Community" (<A href="bword://EEC">EEC</A>). <BR><BR><B>The European Commission </B> <BR>is the politically independent institution that represents and upholds the interests of the European Union as a whole. It proposes legislation, policies and programmes of action and it is responsible for implementing the decisions of Parliament and the Council.
EEA	This acronym refers to the <B> European Economic Area</B> - which consists of the European Union and all the <A href="bword://EFTA">EFTA</A> countries except Switzerland. The EEA Agreement, which entered into force on 1 January 1994, enables Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway to enjoy the benefits of the EU's single market without the full privileges and responsibilities of EU membership.<BR>
EEC	This is the acronym for the <B> European Economic Community</B> - an organization set up in the 1957- to bring about economic integration in Europe. There were originally six member countries: Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg and the Netherlands. In 1993, when the Treaty of Maastricht came into force, the EEC was re-named the European Community (EC) and it forms the basis of today's European Union.
EFTA	this is the acronym for the <B> European Free Trade Association</B> - an organization founded in 1960 to promote free trade in goods amongst its member states. There were originally seven EFTA countries: Austria, Denmark, Norway, Portugal, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom (UK). Finland joined in 1961, Iceland in 1970, and Liechtenstein in 1991. In 1973, the UK and Denmark left EFTA and joined the <A href="bword://EEC">EEC</A>. They were followed by Portugal in 1986, and by Austria, Finland and Sweden in 1995. Today the EFTA members are <B> Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland</B>.
ERASMUS	This is not really eurojargon. Named after the great Renaissance scholar, it is an EU-supported education programme that began in 1987. Thanks to this programme, more than a million young Europeans have been able to spend time studying in another EU country. Students sometimes speak of taking "an Erasmus year".
EUROPA	This is not really eurojargon. It was the ancient Greek and Latin name for Europe, and it is now the name of the European Union's official <A href="http://europa.eu.int/index_en.htm"> website</A>. This contains a wealth of useful information about the EU, regularly updated, and it is available in all the official languages of the EU.
Enhanced co-operation	This is an arrangement whereby a group of EU countries (there must be at least eight of them) can work together in a particular field even if the other EU countries are unable or unwilling to join in at this stage. The outsiders must, however, be free to join in later if they wish.
Enlargement of the EU	In the 1950s, the EU began with just six member states. It now has 25. Growth in EU membership is known as "enlargement", and it has happened several times. The most recent enlargement, in May 2004, added ten more member states: the Czech Republic, Estonia, Cyprus, Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary, Malta, Poland, Slovenia and Slovakia.
Eurobarometer	This is a Commission service, set up in 1973, which measures and analyses trends in public opinion in all the member states (old and new) and in the candidate countries. Knowing what the general public thinks is important in helping the European Commission draft its legislative proposals, take decisions and evaluate its work.<BR>Eurobarometer uses both opinion polls and focus groups. Its surveys lead to the publication of around 100 reports every year. For further information go to the <A href="http://europa.eu.int/comm/public_opinion"> Eurobarometer website</A>. Eurocrat The term "Eurocrats" (a pun on the word "bureaucrats") refers to the many thousands of EU citizens who work for the European institutions (Parliament, the Council, the Commission, etc.).
Euroland	This is an unofficial nickname for what is officially called "the euro area" - also often referred to as "the euro zone"..This area consists of the EU member states that have adopted the euro as their currency. So far the countries involved are Belgium, Germany, Greece, Spain, France, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, The Netherlands, Austria, Portugal, Finland.
Europe Day|9th May	Europe Day, 9th May<br>\nIt was on 9 May 1950 that Robert Schuman (then French Foreign Minister) made his famous speech proposing <A href="bword://European integration">European integration</A> as the way to secure peace and build prosperity in post-war Europe. His proposals laid the foundations for what is now the European Union, so 9 May is celebrated annually as the EU's birthday.
European Year of	" European Year of..."<br>\nEvery year or two, the EU draws public attention to a particular European issue by organising a series of special events in connection with it. 2004 is the European Year of Education through Sport.
European integration	This means building unity between European countries and peoples. Within the European Union it means that countries pool their resources and take many decisions jointly. This joint decision-making takes place through interaction between the EU institutions (the Parliament, the Council, the Commission, etc.).
Eurosceptic	This term is often used to mean a person who is opposed to European integration or who is "sceptical" of the EU and its aims.
Federalism	Broadly speaking, this means any system of government where several states form a unity and yet remain independent in their internal affairs. People who are in favour of this system are often called "federalists".<BR>A number of countries around the world - e.g. Australia, Canada, Germany, Switzerland and the United States - have federal models of government, in which some matters (such as foreign policy) are decided at the federal level while others are decided by the individual states. However, the model differs from one country to another.<BR>The European Union is not based on any of these models: it is not a federation but a unique form of union in which the member states remain independent and sovereign nations while pooling their sovereignty in many areas of common interest. This gives them a collective strength and influence on the world stage than none of them could have on their own.<BR>Part of the debate about the future of Europe is the question of whether the EU should or should not become more "federal".
Financial perspective	The word "perspective" here really means "plan". The EU has to plan its work well in advance and ensure that it has enough money to pay for what it wants to do. So its main institutions (Parliament, the Council and the Commission) have to agree in advance on the priorities for the next few years and come up with a spending plan which is called a "financial perspective". This financial perspective states the maximum amount the EU can spend, and what it can spend it on.<BR>In a world of rising costs, the purpose of the financial perspective is to keep EU expenditure under control.
Fortress Europe	This expression is often used to mean an attitude that wants to defend Europe from outside influences, especially cultural influences. The term "Fortress Europe" often appears in discussions about asylum and immigration regulations. Founding fathers In the years following the Second World War, people like Jean Monnet and Robert Schuman dreamed of uniting the peoples of Europe in lasting peace and friendship. Over the following fifty years, as the EU was built, their dream became reality. That is why they are called the "founding fathers" of the European Union.
Four freedoms	One of the great achievements of the EU has been to create a frontier-free area within which (I) people, (2) goods, (3) services and (4) money can all move around freely. This four-fold freedom of movement is sometimes called "the four freedoms".
Free trade area	This means a group of countries that have removed barriers to trade between them - barriers such as import tariffs and quotas. Several free trade areas have been established around the world: Mercosur in South America, Nafta in North America and EFTA in Europe, for example. The European Union is also a free trade area, but it is much more than that because it is built on a process of economic and political integration, with joint decision-taking in many policy areas.
Harmonisation	This may mean bringing national laws into line with one another, very often in order to remove national barriers that obstruct the free movement of workers, goods, services and capital. In other words, harmonisation means making sure that, on any particular issue for which the EU has responsibility, the rules laid down by the different EU countries impose similar obligations on citizens of all those countries and that they impose certain minimum obligations in each country.<BR><BR>Harmonisation can also mean co-ordinating national technical rules so that products and services can be traded freely throughout the EU. Contrary to popular myth, this does not mean pointlessly standardising everything from the curvature of cucumbers to the colour of carrots. Often it simply means that EU countries recognise one another's safety rules.
Intergovernmental Conference|IGC	Intergovernmental Conference (IGC)<br>\nThis means a conference at which the EU member states' governments come together to amend the European Union treaties. An IGC was held in 2003, when the plan was to merge all the present treaties into a single, simplified treaty (or "constitution") setting out the EU's aims and policies and saying who is responsible for doing what. The IGC did not reach agreement on the new text, so further discussions will be held.
Lisbon strategy	To compete with other major world players, the EU needs a modern efficient economy. Meeting in Lisbon in March 2000, the EU's political leaders set it a new goal: to become, within a decade, "the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world, capable of sustainable growth with more and better jobs and greater social cohesion."<BR><BR>The EU's leaders also agreed on a detailed strategy for achieving this goal. The "Lisbon strategy" covers such matters as research, education, training, Internet access and on-line business. It also covers reform of Europe's social protection systems, which must be made sustainable so that their benefits can be enjoyed by future generations. Every spring the European Council meets to review progress in implementing the Lisbon strategy.
Mainstreaming	Put simply, mainstreaming an issue means making sure it is fully taken into account in all EU polices. For example, every European Union policy decision must now take account of its environmental implications. In other words, environmental considerations have been "mainstreamed".
Member state	The countries that belong to an international organisation are its "member states". The term is also often used to mean the governments of those countries. From 1 May 2004, the member states of the European Union are Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Germany, Estonia, Greece, Spain, France, Ireland, Italy, Cyprus, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Hungary, Malta, the Netherlands, Austria, Poland, Portugal, Slovenia, Slovakia, Finland, Sweden and the United Kingdom.
Official languages	From 1 May 2004 there are 20 official languages in the European Union: Czech, Danish, German, Estonian, Greek, English, Spanish, French, Italian, Latvian, Lithuanian, Hungarian, Maltese, Dutch, Polish, Portuguese, Slovenian, Slovak, Finnish and Swedish. EU legislation is published in all the official languages, and you may use any of these languages to correspond with the EU institutions. In addition, of course, there are many other languages spoken in Europe, and this diversity of national and regional languages is something Europeans cherish. It is part of their rich cultural heritage. The European Commission runs programmes to promote language learning and linguistic diversity..
Pillars of the EU	the European Union takes decisions in three separate "domains" (policy areas), also known as the three "pillars" of the EU.<BR><BR>•The first pillar is the "Community domain", covering most of the common policies, where decisions are taken by the "<A href="bword://Community method">Community method</A>" - involving the Commission, Parliament and the Council. <BR>•The second pillar is the common foreign and security policy, where decisions are taken by the Council alone. <BR>•The third pillar is "police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters", where - once again - the Council takes the decisions. <BR><BR>Within the first pillar, the Council normally takes decisions by "qualified majority" vote (see the <A href="http://europa.eu.int/scadplus/leg/en/cig/g4000.htm"> glossary</A>). In the other pillars, the Council decision has to be unanimous: it can therefore be blocked by the veto of any one country.<BR><BR>If the Council so decides, it can use the "<A href="bword://Community bridge">Community bridge</A>" to transfer certain matters from the third to the first pillar.
Rendez-vous clause	Sometimes, when EU leaders are discussing an important legal document such as a new treaty, they cannot reach agreement on a particular issue. So they may decide to come back to this subject at a later date. Their decision is made official by putting it in writing and including it as a clause in the legal text they are discussing. This type of clause is sometimes known as a "rendez vous clause".
Schengen land|the Schengen area|the Schengen countries	(= the Schengen area, the Schengen countries)<br>\nIn 1985, five EU countries (France, Germany, Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands) agreed to abolish all checks on people travelling between them. This created a territory without internal borders which became known as the <B> Schengen area</B>. (Schengen is the town in Luxembourg where the agreement was signed).<BR><BR>The Schengen countries introduced a common visa policy for the whole area and agreed to establish effective controls at its <B> external</B> borders. Checks at the <B> internal</B> borders may be carried out for a limited period if public order or national security make this necessary.<BR><BR>Little by little, the Schengen area has been extended to include every EU country plus Iceland and Norway, and the agreement has become an integral part of the EU treaties. However, Ireland and the United Kingdom do not take part in the arrangements relating to border controls and visas. <A href="http://europa.eu.int/scadplus/leg/en/lvb/l33020.htm"> More on this subject</A>. <BR><BR>You do not need a visa for travelling within the Schengen area if you are a citizen of one of the Schengen countries. If you have a visa for entering any Schengen country it automatically allows you to travel freely throughout the Schengen area, except Ireland and the United Kingdom.
Social Dumping	This is the process whereby manufacturers close down factories in high-wage areas and set them up in areas where labour is cheap. This cuts costs and boosts company profits, but often at the expense of creating unemployment in Europe.
Stakeholder	Any person or organisation with an interest in or affected by EU legislation and policymaking is a "stakeholder" in that process. The European Commission makes a point of consulting as wide a range of stakeholders as possible before proposing new legislation or new policy initiatives.
Strasbourg	Strasbourg is a French city located close to the border with Germany. The plenary sessions of the European Parliament are held here for one week every month. It is also home to the European Court of Human Rights and the Council of Europe - which are not EU institutions. The term "Strasbourg" is sometimes used in the media to mean one or other of these bodies.
Subsidiarity	The "subsidiarity principle" means that EU decisions must be taken as closely as possible to the citizen. In other words, the Union does not take action (except on matters for which it alone is responsible) unless EU action is more effective than action taken at national, regional or local level. Summit Meetings of the <A href="bword://The European Council">European Council</A> are sometimes referred to as European (or EU) "summit" meetings, because they bring together the EU's heads of state or government. Some countries are represented by their Prime Minister, others by their President, some by both. It depends on their Constitution.
The Council of Europe|Council of Europe	This is not an EU institution. It is an intergovernmental organization based in Strasbourg and it aims (amongst other things) to protect human rights, to promote Europe's cultural diversity and to combat social problems such as xenophobia and intolerance. The Council of Europe was set up in 1949 and one of its early achievements was to draw up the European Convention on Human Rights. To enable citizens to exercise their rights under that Convention it set up the European Court of Human Rights.
The Council of the European Union|Council of the European Union	Formerly known as the Council of Ministers, this institution consists of government ministers from all the EU countries. The Council meets regularly to take detailed decisions and to pass European laws.
The European Commission|European Commission	is the politically independent institution that represents and upholds the interests of the European Union as a whole. It proposes legislation, policies and programmes of action and it is responsible for implementing the decisions of Parliament and the Council.
The European Community|European Community	is the present name for what was originally called the "European Economic Community" (<A href="bword://EEC">EEC</A> ).
The European Council|European Council	This is the meeting of heads of State and government (i.e. presidents and/or prime ministers) of all the EU countries, plus the President of the European Commission. The European Council meets, in principle, four times a year to agree overall EU policy and to review progress. It is the highest-level policy-making body in the European Union, which is why its meetings are often called "summits".
Third country	This phrase simply means a non-EU country. The meaning is clearest when we are speaking about relations between two EU member states (or between the EU institutions and a member state) and another country - literally a third country - that is outside the European Union.
Transnational	This word is often used to describe cooperation between businesses or organisations based in more than one EU country. Part of the EU's purpose is to encourage this cross-border or "transnational" cooperation.
Transparency	The term "transparency" is often used to mean openness in the way the EU institutions work. The EU institutions are committed to greater openness. They are taking steps to improve public access to information, and they are working to produce clearer and more readable documents. This includes better drafting of laws and, ultimately, a single, simplified EU Treaty.
Two-speed Europe	This refers to the theoretical possibility that, in future, a particular "core" group of EU Member States may decide to move faster than others along the road of <A href="bword://European integration">European integration</A>. It is already possible for a group of EU countries to work together more closely than others under an arrangement known as "<A href="bword://enhanced co-operation">enhanced co-operation</A>".
