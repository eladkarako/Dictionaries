Agent-15|Agent15	Psychedelic drug, chemical warfare agent. <BR> <BR>Little information is publicly known about Agent-15, except that it is closely related to <A href='bword://BZ'>BZ</A> . The understanding of its physiological effects is based on studies with the latter agent. <BR> <BR>The existence of Agent-15 in Iraq's arsenals was revealed by the British Secretary of State George Robertson in a statement to the House of Commons on 9 February 1998. According to the statement, Iraq may have possessed large quantities of the agent since the 1980s. A document found by the UN Special Commission on Iraq (UNSCOM) in August 1995 contained a brief reference to Agent-15 and subsequent assessment of relevant scientific and other background material indicated the size of the stockpile. <BR> <BR>Agent-15 belongs to the glycollates, a large group of chemicals which also includes the chemical warfare agent BZ. <BR> <BR>The chemicals block cholinergic nerve transmission in the central and peripheral nervous system. The main effects of exposure to Agent-15 are believed to be: dilated pupils, flushed faces, dry mouth, rapid heart beat (tachycardia), increase in skin and body temperature, weakness, dizziness, disorientation, visual hallucinations, confusions, loss of time sense, loss of coordination and stupor. <BR> <BR>More information: <BR><A href='http://projects.sipri.se/cbw/'>SIPRI Chemical and Biological Warfare Project </A>

Ballistite	<A href='bword://Explosive'>Explosive</A>, Ballistite is a double-base <A href='bword://smokelesspowder'>powder</A> used as a rocket propellant. It is composed of two explosive substances, nitrocellulose and nitroglycerin, blended together with diphenylamine, which acts as a stabilizer. It burns with a considerable amount of flash and smoke, and generates a great volume of gas. Ballistite burns progressively, but at a rate dependent upon the composition and physical characteristics of the powder grain, the temperature of the powder grain before ignition, and the pressure during reaction. It is produced in various shapes to fit the rocket motor housing. <BR> <BR>Basically, solid propellant charges, such as Ballistite, may be grouped under one of two types- restricted-burning and unrestricted burning. <BR> <BR>A restricted-burning charge has some of its exposed surfaces covered with an inhibitor to control burning. By this procedure, burning can be restricted to take place only on the desired surface or surfaces. Controlling the burning area in this manner lengthens burning duration and determines the combustion chamber pressure for a given charge. A burning cigarette is a good example of restricted-burning, if you consider the paper-covered portion as representing the inhibited area. <BR> <BR>Unrestricted-burning charges are permitted to burn on all surfaces simultaneously. Relatively speaking, the unrestricted type of grain delivers a large amount of thrust for a short period of time, and the restricted type of grain yields a smaller amount of thrust for a longer period of time.

BZ	(Bravo/Zulu) Well Done; Good Job <BR> <BR>Alternatively: <BR> <BR>3-quinuclidinyl benzilate (BZ) <BR>Chemical warfare agent (depressant) <BR> <BR>BZ and its analogues are glycollic acid esters. Some members of the group are liquid at ambient temperatures but BZ is a stable white crystalline powder that is only slightly soluble in water. After administration of an effective dose by inhalation by mouth or by injection mild peripheral effects of BZ occur within 1 hour and maximal central effects occur after about 4 hours lasting 24 to 48 hours, with a peak at 8 to 10 hours. Some other compounds in this group may take longer for their effects to develop and to disappear. Doubling the dose prolongs the duration of severe central effects by about 40 hours and shortens the onset time of severe effects to about 1 hour. <BR> <BR><B>Depressants</B> produce their effects by interfering with transmission of information across central synapses. An example of this type of agent is 3-quinuclidinyl benzilate (BZ), which blocks the muscarinic action of acetylcholine both peripherally and centrally. In the central nervous system anticholinergic compounds disrupt the high integrative functions of memory, problem solving, attention and comprehension. Relatively high doses produce toxic delirium which destroys the ability to perform any military task. <BR> <BR> <BR><B>Protection</B>It is likely that such agents will be dispersed by smoke-producing munitions or aerosols, using the respiratory tract as a portal of entry. The use of the protective mask, therefore, is essential. With some agents the percutaneous route may be used and full individual protective equipment will be required. <BR>

CoE	<B>The Council of Europe </B> <BR><B> <BR>Origins and membership</B>The Council of Europe is the continent's oldest political organisation, founded in 1949. It:· groups together 43 countries, including 19 ex-communist countries (see paragraph on "the pan-European dimension"), · has applications from 3 more countries, · has granted observer status to 5 more countries (the Holy See, the United States, Canada, Japan and Mexico), · is distinct from the 15-nation European Union, but no country has ever joined the Union without first belonging to the Council of Europe, · has its headquarters in Strasbourg, in north-eastern France. <B>Aims</B>The Council was set up to:· defend human rights, parliamentary democracy and the rule of law, · develop continent-wide agreements to standardise member countries' social and legal practices, · promote awareness of a European identity based on shared values and cutting across different cultures. Since 1989, its main job has become:· acting as a political anchor and human rights watchdog for Europe's post-communist democracies, · assisting the countries of central and eastern Europe in carrying out and consolidating political, legal and constitutional reform in parallel with economic reform, · providing know-how in areas such as human rights, local democracy, education, culture and the environment. <B>Political aims</B>The Council of Europe's Vienna Summit in October 1993 set out new political aims. The Heads of State and Government cast the Council of Europe as the guardian of democratic security - founded on human rights, democracy and the rule of law. Democratic security is an essential complement to military security, and is a pre-requisite for the continent's stability and peace.During the Second Summit in Strasbourg in October 1997, the Heads of State and Government adopted an action plan to strengthen the Council of Europe's work in four areas: democracy and human rights, social cohesion, the security of citizens and democratic values and cultural diversity.Today, the Organisation continues to grow while at the same time increasing its monitoring to ensure that all its members respect the obligations and commitments they entered into when they joined.<B>How it works</B>The main component parts of the Council of Europe are:· the <B>Committee of Ministers</B>, composed of the 43 foreign ministers or their Strasbourg-based deputies (ambassadors/permanent representatives), which is the Organisation's decision-making body. It is currently chaired by Liechtenstein. · the <B>Parliamentary Assembly</B>, grouping 602 members (301 representatives and 301 substitutes) from the 43 national parliaments and Special Guest delegations from the two parliaments of east European non-member states. The current President is the Austrian Socialist Peter Schieder. · the <B>Congress of Local and Regional Authorities</B>, composed of a Chamber of Local Authorities and a Chamber of Regions. Its current President is Llibert Cuatrecasas of Spain. · the 1300-strong secretariat headed since 1999 by Secretary General Walter Schwimmer (Austria) former Vice-President of the parliamentary Assembly and former President of the Group of the European's people party.  <BR>Homepage: <A href='http://www.coe.int/'>http://www.coe.int/</A> <BR> <BR> <BR>Alternatives: <BR>Corps of engineers; <BR>Certification of Equivalency; <BR>Center Of Excellence <BR>

FES	Friedrich-Ebert-Stiftung <BR><BR><BR>The foundation was founded in 1925 as a political legacy of Germany's first democratically elected president, Friedrich Ebert, who died in that year. <BR>Ebert, a Social Democrat of humble origins, had risen to hold the highest office in his country despite considerable opposition from his political adversaries. He assumed the burden of the presidency in a country which was crisis-ridden following its defeat in World War I. His own personal experience led him to propose the establishment of a foundation with a threefold aim: <BR> <BR>furthering a democratic, pluralistic political culture by means of political education for all classes of society, <BR> <BR>facilitating access to higher education for gifted young people by providing scholarships, <BR> <BR>contributing to international understanding and co-operation wherever possible to avert a fresh outbreak of war and conflict. <BR> <BR><BR>The Foundation, which was immediately banned by the Nazis in 1933 and not re-established until 1947 after World War II, continues today to pursue those aims and has developed extensive programmes in each of the above areas. <BR> <BR>The Friedrich-Ebert-Stiftung today is a non-profit making, political public-interest institution committed to the principles and basic values of social democracy in its educational and policy-orientated work. <BR> <BR>Homepage: <A href='http://www.fes.de/'>http://www.fes.de/</A> <BR>

It draws attention to the fact that assumptions are often made in project design, and requires these to be listed. Indicators of outcomes, goals and objectives should also be described and used for monitoring and evaluating the intervention. <BR><BR>Document with a full discussion:<BR><A href='http://www.livelihoods.org/post/Docs/logframe.rtf'>http://www.livelihoods.org/post/Docs/logframe.rtf</A> <BR>.<BR><BR>

Nerve Gas|NerveGas	Among the most dangerous chemical weapons are the so called nerve gasses or nerve agents, nerve agents have entirely dominated chemical warfare since the Second World War. Nerve agents acquired their name because they affect the transmission of nerve impulses in the nervous system. All nerve agents belong chemically to the group of organo-phosphorus compounds. They are stable and easily dispersed, highly toxic and have rapid effects both when absorbed through the skin and via respiration. Nerve agents can be manufactured by means of fairly simple chemical techniques. The raw materials are inexpensive and generally readily available. This makes them even more dangerous as they can be made by any irresponsible mind with a decent laboratory. <BR>

In 1992, the then CSCE (now OSCE) deployed the first Mission to Kosovo, Sandjak and Vojvodina. The Mission mandates were not renewed the following year. <BR> <BR>From October 1998 to March 1999, the Kosovo Verification Mission (KVM), the largest and most challenging OSCE operation up to that date, was deployed to verify FRY compliance with United Nations Security Council Resolutions 1160 and 1199; to verify the cease-fire, monitor movement of forces, and promote human rights and democracy-building. Following a deterioration in the security situation, the KVM was withdrawn from Kosovo in March 1999. <BR> <BR>Homepage: <A href='http://www.osce.org/kosovo/'>http://www.osce.org/kosovo/</A> <BR> <BR>

Irritation of the larynx by very large concentrations of the agent may lead to sudden laryngeal spasm and death. The most prominent symptom following the latent period is difficulty breathing, perceived as shortness of breath with or without chest tightness.

Sarin|GB|T-113|Zarin	<A href='bword://NerveGas'>Nerve Gas</A> <BR> <BR>Sarin, developed in 1938, is the most toxic of the three G-agents made by Germany. Its name is derived from the names of the chemists involved in its creation: <B>S</B>chräder, <B>A</B>mbrose, <B>R</B>üdiger and van der L<B>in</B>de. NATO adopted it as a standard chemical warfare agent in the early 1950s. Iraq used sarin in the 1980-88 war with Iran and had large stocks available in the 1990-91 Gulf War. The Japanese Aum Shinrikyo religious sect released an impure form of sarin in Matsumoto in 1994 and in the Tokyo underground in 1995. <BR> <BR>Nerve agents in general attack the nervous system of the human body. When a nerve receives a stimulus acetylcholine is released in order to carry the impulse to muscles and organs. Once the impulse has passed the enzyme cholinesterase acts to prevent the accumulation of acetylcholine after its release in the nervous system. Nerve agents inhibit the functioning of cholinesterase, as a consequence of which the acetylcholine continues to act so that nervous impulses keep on being transmitted. The first symptoms a victim will experience following exposure to nerve agents are a runny nose, tightness in the chest and constriction of the pupils (miosis). The victim will then encounter breathing difficulties, drooling from the mouth and nausea. Because he loses control over his bodily functions, he will involuntary vomit, defecate and urinate. This phase is followed by twitching and jerking. Ultimately the victim will become comatose and suffocate as a consequence of convulsive spasms. <BR> <BR>Sarin is a highly volatile liquid, so that inhalation as well as absorption through the skin pose a great threat. Even vapour concentrations will immediately penetrate the skin. Death may follow in one minute after direct ingestion of extremely low concentrations (0.01 mg per kg of body weight or higher). People who did not accumulate a lethal dose but did not receive immediate appropriate medical treatment may suffer permanent neurological damage. <BR> <BR>More information: <BR><A href='http://projects.sipri.se/cbw/'>SIPRI Chemical and Biological Warfare Project</A> <BR>

Semtex	<A href='bword://Explosive'>Explosive</A> (supposedly hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine, though it is still a trade secret and other sources speak on penterythritol tetranitrate), <BR> <BR>Semtex, being extremely stable, is extremely difficult to explode accidentally, unless it is detonated with a detonator or Initiator. It has a texture of Plastercene and is like kneaded dough, with bouncy elasticity. It is odorless and has low level of fumes (Nitrogen Molecules) when dormant. This makes it difficult to detect it with the normal "Sniffer" machines and animals. Molded shapes of Semtex are said to have the capability of passing undetected through the x-ray luggage screening machines installed at the airports. The most sure way of detecting Semtex is by bathing it in Neutrons to bring up the atomic pictures. However such equipment is extremely expensive. <BR> <BR>The Semtex is similar to the American explosive <A href='bword://C4'>C4</A> which is a mixture of <A href='bword://RDX'>RDX</A> and <A href='bword://PETN'>PETN</A> explosives. Semtex, being the plastic explosives has about 27 similar explosives manufactured all over the world under different patents and names. <BR> <BR>Semtex is being used in local improvising and manufacture of accelerants for detonating larger bombs. The large are the size that were used in the attack at Canary Wharf and Manchaster some time back. Semtex is also being used to improvise Mortar Bombs. The Semtex explosive is extremely powerful as compared to other explosives. <BR> <BR>Read more: <A href='http://www.terrorism.com/index.shtml'>The Terrorism Research Center</A> <BR>

SL	The <B>sustainable livelihoods</B> (SL) approach provides a methodology and a framework for analysing and understanding realistic priorities for development. It advocates a set of <I>principles</I> that should underpin poverty focussed development activities: putting poor people at the centre of development; building on people’s strengths rather than their needs; cross-sectoral thinking; understanding the linkages between policy decisions and local realities; responding quickly to changing circumstances; and ensuring long-term sustainability. <BR><BR>The SL <I>framework</I> is a tool to improve our understanding of livelihoods, by illustrating the main factors that affect people’s livelihoods (e.g. access to assets; vulnerability; policies, institutions and processes), and the typical relationships between these (see SL guidance sheets available at: <A href='http://www.livelihoods.org/info/info_guidancesheets.html'>http://www.livelihoods.org/info/info_guidancesheets.html</A>).<BR><BR>Document with a full discussion:<BR><A href='http://www.livelihoods.org/post/Docs/logframe.rtf'>http://www.livelihoods.org/post/Docs/logframe.rtf</A> <BR>.<BR><BR>

Soman|GD|T-300	Although the third <A href='bword://nervegas'>nerve agent</A> developed in Germany, soman received the Allied coding GD. No chemical agent was ever coded GC, as it used to be the medical reference for the disease gonorrhea. While continuing the research after the discovery of sarin, the German chemists first came across a more toxic substance, called T-210, which was apparently not further developed, before discovering soman in 1944. The origin of the name is uncertain and may have been derived from Greek ('sleep') or Latin ('bludgeon'). <BR> <BR>After World War II, soman was incorporated into the Soviet arsenals. A thickened variant was developed for use in 250kg chemical spray tanks. The thickened soman is a yellowish-brown, highly viscous liquid with a slight aromatic odour. During the 1980s, many Western sources referred to this agent as VR-55, but more recent literature identifies VR-55 as an isomer of VX. <BR> <BR>Nerve agents in general attack the nervous system of the human body. When a nerve receives a stimulus acetylcholine is released in order to carry the impulse to muscles and organs. Once the impulse has passed the enzyme cholinesterase acts to prevent the accumulation of acetylcholine after its release in the nervous system. Nerve agents inhibit the functioning of cholinesterase, as a consequence of which the acetylcholine continues to act so that nervous impulses keep on being transmitted. The first symptoms a victim will experience following exposure to nerve agents are a runny nose, tightness in the chest and constriction of the pupils (miosis). The victim will then encounter breathing difficulties, drooling from the mouth and nausea. Because he loses control over his bodily functions, he will involuntary vomit, defecate and urinate. This phase is followed by twitching and jerking. Ultimately the victim will become comatose and suffocate as a consequence of convulsive spasms. <BR> <BR>Soman is extremely toxic by absorption through the skin and death will follow about 15 minutes after a lethal dose has been absorbed. In case of inhalation or absorption of a lethal dose through the eyes, death will occur between 1 and 10 minutes. Soman is readily absorbed into the bloodstream and reacts immediately with neural tissue, particularly in the brain, which explains its greater lethality. Inhibited acetylcholinesterase cannot be reactivated, so that some forms of medical treatment against nerve agents, such as oxime-based drugs to give the body time to destroy and excrete the toxic substances, are useless against soman. <BR> <BR>More information: <BR><A href='http://projects.sipri.se/cbw/'>SIPRI Chemical and Biological Warfare Project </A>

SP	South Eastern Europe Stability Pact <BR><BR>The Stability Pact is the first serious attempt by the international community to replace the previous, reactive crisis intervention policy in South Eastern Europe with a comprehensive, long-term conflict prevention strategy. On 10 June 1999, at the EU's initiative, the Stability Pact for South Eastern Europe was adopted in Cologne. In the founding docu-ment, more than 40 partner countries and organisations undertook to strengthen the countries of South Eastern Europe "in their efforts to foster peace, democracy, respect for human rights and economic prosperity in order to achieve stability in the whole region". Euro-Atlantic integration was promised to all the countries in the region. At a summit meeting in Sarajevo on 30 July 1999, the Pact was reaffirmed. The idea for the Stability Pact arose in late 1998 and thus predates the Kosovo war. But the NATO intervention undoubtedly acted as a catalyst in strengthening international political will for co-ordinated and preventive action in the region. The Stability Pact is based on key experiences and lessons from worldwide international crisis management. Conflict prevention and peace building can be successful only if they start in parallel in three key sectors: the creation of a secure environment, the promotion of sustainable democratic systems, and the promotion of economic and social well-being. Only if there is progress in all three sectors can a self-sustaining process of peace be achieved<BR><BR>Official Web Page:<BR><A href='http://www.stabilitypact.org/'>http://www.stabilitypact.org/</A> <BR>.<BR>

Tabun|GA|Gelan|Le100|Stoff-83|T-83|Trilon-83	Tabun was the first <A href='bword://nervegas'>nerve agent</A> to be discovered. Dr Gerhard Schräder came across it in 1937 through his research into pesticides based on organophosphorus bondings. Tabun belongs to the G(erman)-class of nerve agent. The word 'tabun' has no particular meaning and was reportedly made up by Dr Schräder to disguise the discovery. The first time Tabun or any other nerve agent ws ever used in war was by Iraq against Iran in 1984. Subsequently, its use was confirmed repeatedly until the end of the war in 1988. <BR> <BR>Nerve agents in general attack the nervous system of the human body. When a nerve receives a stimulus acetylcholine is released in order to carry the impulse to muscles and organs. Once the impulse has passed, the enzyme <I>cholinesterase</I> acts to prevent the accumulation of acetylcholine after its release in the nervous system. Nerve agents inhibit the functioning of cholinesterase, as a consequence of which the acetylcholine continues to act so that nervous impulses continue to be transmitted. The first symptoms a victim will experience following exposure to nerve agents are a runny nose, tightness in the chest and constriction of the pupils (miosis). The victim will then encounter difficulties breathing, drooling from the mouth and nausea. Because of the loss of control over bodily functions, vomiting, defecation and urination occurs. This phase is followed by twitching and jerking. Ultimately the victim will become comatose and will suffocate as a consequence of convulsive spasms. <BR> <BR>Tabun is essentially absorbed through the skin, although vapours can also be hazardous. If a person does not receive an immediate lethal dose, death will occur after approximately 20 minutes. People who did not accumulate a lethal dose but did not receive immediate appropriate medical treatment may suffer permanent neurological damage. <BR> <BR>More information: <BR><A href='http://projects.sipri.se/cbw/'>SIPRI Chemical and Biological Warfare Project</A> <BR>

TNT|Trilite|Trinol|Tritolo|Triton|Troty	2,4,6-trinitrotoluene, <BR> <BR>Trinitrotoluene, commonly known as TNT, is a constituent of many <A href='bword://explosives'>explosives</A> , such as amatol, pentolite, tetrytol, torpex, tritonal, picratol, ednatol, and composition B. It has been used under such names as Triton, Trotyl, Trilite, Trinol, and Tritolo. <BR> <BR>In a refined form, TNT is one of the most stable of high explosives and can be stored over long periods of time. It is relatively insensitive to blows or friction. It is nonhygroscopic and does not form sensitive compounds with metals, but it is readily acted upon by alkalies to form unstable compounds that are very sensitive to heat and impact. TNT may exude an oily brown liquid. This exudate oozes out around the threads at the nose of the shell and may form a pool on the floor. The exudate is flammable and may contain particles of TNT. Pools of exudate should be carefully removed. <BR> <BR>TNT can be used as a booster or as a bursting charge for high-explosive shells and bombs. <BR> <BR>Information from: <A href='http://www.ordnance.org/'>The Ordonance Shop</A> <BR>

VX	<B>Tabun (GA), Sarin (GB), Soman (GD), GF, VX</B> - <BR> <BR>The most toxic of the known chemical agents. <A href='bword://Nervegas'>Nerve agents</A> are extreme hazards in their liquid and vapor states and can cause death minutes after exposure.They affect the transmission of nerve impulses by reacting with the enzyme cholinesterase, permitting an accumulation of acetylcholine and continuous muscle stimulation. The muscles tire due to over- stimulation and begin to contract. Nerve agents are colorless to light brown liquids, some of which are volatile. Toxic liquids are tasteless. Nerve agents may be absorbed through the skin, respiratory tract, gastrointestinal tract, and the eyes. Respiratory contamination is almost immediate.Significant absorption through the skin takes a period of minutes. Prompt medical treatment and decontamination is crucial in either case. <BR> <BR>Nerve agents are considered major military threats. They can be dispersed from missiles, rockets, bombs, howitzer shells, spray tanks, land mines, and other large munitions. <BR> <BR><B>HISTORY/MILITARY RELEVANCE</B> <BR>Nerve agents were developed in pre-World War II Germany. Germany had stockpiles of nerve agent munitions during World War II (WWII), but did not use them for reasons that are still unclear. In the closing days of the war, the U.S. and its allies discovered these stockpiles, developed the agents, and manufactured nerve agent munitions. The U.S. chemical agent stockpile contains the nerve agents GB and VX. <BR> <BR>Nerve agents are considered major military threat agents. The only known battlefield use of nerve agents was in the Iraq-Iran conflict. Intelligence analysts indicate that many countries have the technology to manufacture nerve agent munitions. <BR> <BR><B>Symptoms:</B> Small exposure to vapor brings constriction of the pupils, nasal inflammation, and mild difficulty breathing, while a large exposure to vapor causes sudden loss of consciousness, convulsions, a halt in breathing, paralysis, and death. Small to moderate exposure of liquid on skin produces localized sweating, nausea, vomiting, and a feeling of weakness, while a large exposure to liquid on skin has same effect as vapor exposure. Lethal amounts of vapor or liquid cause a rapid cascade of events culminating, within a minute or two, with loss of consciousness and convulsive activity followed by a halt in breathing within several more minutes. <BR> <BR><B>Treatment:</B> Three drugs--atropine, pralidoxime chloride, and diazepam--are used to treat nerve agent exposure. <BR> <BR><B>Protection:</B> Pyridostigmine bromide as a pretreatment. Protective masks, clothing. <BR> <BR>Persistence is approx 30 minutes (Sarin) to 4-5 hours (Soman), 300-325 hours (VX). <BR>
