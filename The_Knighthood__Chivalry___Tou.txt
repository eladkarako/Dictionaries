This is now called the '<A href="http://www.chronique.com/Library/Glossaries/glossary-KCT/gloss_t.htm#tournament declaration">tournament declaration</A> ', a posting of the tournament or <A href="http://www.chronique.com/Library/Glossaries/glossary-KCT/gloss_t.htm#tournaments, rules for">rules</A> of a <A href="http://www.chronique.com/Library/Glossaries/glossary-KCT/gloss_p.htm#pas d'armes">pas d'armes</A> , generally published in advance of the tourney.
'Faites vos devoirs!'|Faites vos devoirs	<A href="bword://Heraldry and Heralds">Herald’s</A> cry for combatants to prepare themselves, to hold themselves ready, uttered three times in a <A href="bword://Judicial Duel">judicial duel</A> .
Abbey	Society of monks or nuns governed by an abbot or for women, an abbess, and by extension the buildings themselves. Abbeys gathered unto themselves large tracts of land as wealthy men became monks, but the constant struggle between the secular authority and the church resulted in many confiscations.
Abbot	A "chief monk" in the head of a monastary or an abbey.
Accolade	Ceremony conferring the honor of <A href="bword://Knighthood">knighthood</A> . Generally the most important element of the accolade historically was the girding on of the <A href="bword://Sword">sword</A> , the giving of the <A href="bword://Military belt">military belt</A> that signified the &quotcoming of age" in a martial sense. See also <A href="http://www.chronique.com/Chronique/chrniq05.htm">Chronique: The Journal of Chivalry #5</A> for more knighting ceremonies.
Accoutrement	All the pieces of a knight’s office: his <A href="bword://Sword">sword</A> , symbolizing justice and mercy; his <A href="bword://Spurs">spurs</A> , <A href="bword://Chain (of fealty)">chain of fealty</A> , and <A href="bword://Military belt">military belt</A> .
Acre	A port city on the Bay of Haifa in the eastern Mediterranean, a critical city in the <A href="bword://Holy Lands">Holy Lands</A> , seized by Christian armies in 1104, but retaken by Saladin in 1187, recaptured by Richard I in 1191, finally falling to the <A href="bword://Saracen">Saracens</A> for the last time in 1291.
Admiral	Derived from an old <A href="bword://Saracen">Saracen</A> term ‘<A href="bword://Emir">emir</A> ,’ meaning prince. Sometime during the late 13th century it became used as naval term of rank as leader for a fleet of ships—possibly ‘prince of the sea.’

Adventurous Shield	A <A href="bword://Shield (construction of)">shield</A> in the White Abbey, destined for Galahad, the perfect knight in Arthurian legend.
Agincourt, Battle of|Agincourt|Battle of Agincourt	25 October 1415. The monumental battle between Henry V and the French forces arrayed against him, slaying three French <A href="bword://Duke">dukes</A> , the <A href="bword://Constable">constable</A> of France, nine <A href="bword://Count">counts</A> , 90 lords and more than 5,000 <A href="bword://Knight">knights</A> . The battle crushed the French resistance to Henry’s renewed claim to the French throne, resulting in the Treaty of Troyes, 1420, in which Henry was betrothed to Catherine and thus their heir of France. It was this battle that Shakespeare immortalized in his &quotSaint Crispen’s Day" speech in <B><I>Henry V</B></I>.
Aiguilette	Literally "point of a shield," the small metal end that was capped onto a lacing point in order to keep it from fraying. Also called aglet, aiglet, anglet.
Ailettes, ailets|Ailettes|ailets	(Fr. &quotlittle wings") small square shields applied to the shoulders commonly worn during the 13th century. Commonly worn by crusaders. They were often painted with a heraldic device; the last reference I was able to locate was from 1313 when Piers Gaveston wore a pair covered in pearls. Not popular after the mid-14th century.
Aketon,acton,arming coat,auqueton,gambeson,hacketon,wambais,wambesium,wambesium,wambs|Aketon|acton|arming coat|auqueton|gambeson|hacketon|haqueton|wambais|wambesium|wambs	A kind of arming coat worn during the 13th - 15th century both as a complete armour unto itself and as padding for additional armour worn over the top. They were generally quilted, either sewn or stuffed with linen, tow or even grass. Most of the illustrations from the 14th century show many buttons or laces up the front, and there are a few examples that feature a high collar to assist in the <A href="bword://Neck, defense of">defense of the neck</A> . 14th century Aketons were generally cut wide around the arm holes in a manner that followed the line of the <A href="bword://breastplate">breastplate</A> or <A href="bword://cuirass">cuirass</A> . These extra-large arm-holes served to grant complete mobility for a full range of arm motion while providing a last-ditch defense of the area under the arm. I can find no evidence of Aketons ever being open under the arm, though this is a common SCA style. See also the <A href="bword://pourpoint">pourpoint</A> , a garment worn under the arming coat useful for attaching the laces for the attachment of a <A href="bword://leg harness">leg harness</A> . A workable pattern for a 14th century model can be found in <A href="http://www.chronique.com/Chronique/chrniq02.htm">Chronique: The Journal of Chivalry #2</A> . <BR>Major Developments during the 14th century<BR>- 1300-1350 Knights wore the haubergeon over their aketon<BR>- 1350-1400 Aketon shortened and begins to be worn under the <A href="http://www.chronique.com/Library/Glossaries/glossary-AA/arms_c.htm#jupon">jupon</A> , sometimes the only body defense. Strongly wasp-waisted form common to the period.<BR>- 1350-1400 Sleeves were sometimes &quotbanana sleeved" or ballooning out or were narrow so as to fit under the <A href="bword://arm harness">arm harness</A> . Both seem popular for the entire period.
Albion	Britain.
Albuquerque	Spanish <A href="bword://Castle">castle</A> built by Alfonso Sanches during the very early 14th century. It is situated on a commanding pinnacle of rock, overlooking rich countryside. It was beseiged many times during the conflict between Castile and Portugal.
Alexander	A late 14th century English prose work in which Alexander the Great encounters an Amazon queen, battles Darius and later marries his daughter Roxana, and accounts for his death by poison at age 33. Also an incomplete High German courtly epic by Rudolf von Ems, where he is depicted as the ideal medieval ruler—brave, just, and generous.
Alexandre,  Roman de|Roman de Alexandre	An Old French epic after which the unique 12 syllable verse form was named ‘alexandrine.’ The work went through many hands, evolving during two centuries.
Alexiad	The 12th century account of the Byzantine princess Anna Comnena, wherein the earliest reliable reference to tourney-like games is found. The following quotation is from a French Crusader heard at court to say: <BR><BR><I>&quotI am a pure Frank and of noble birth. One thing I know: at a crossroads in the country where I was born in an ancient shrine; to this anyone who wishes to engage in single combat goes, prepared to fight; there he prays to God for help and he stays awaiting the man who will dare to answer his challenge. At that crossroads have I often spent time, waiting and longing for the man who would fight, but there was never a one who dared."</I>
Alleron	The wing-tip of a hawk.
Allure	Walkway along the <A href="bword://Ramparts">ramparts</A> of a <A href="bword://Castle">castle</A> .
Almain	Germany
Almerie	A pantry or buttery.
Almoner	Member of the priest’s staff in <A href="bword://Court">court</A> or in a <A href="bword://Castle">castle</A> , responsible for offerings to the poor. The almoner gathered leftovers from the table, made gifts of cloth and tallow to the poor.
Alms	Monetary penance. Usually a priest hearing confession of a member of the nobility would assign a small value in alms to be paid to the poor.
Alms House	Originally an a house attached to an <A href="bword://Abbey">abbey</A> were <A href="bword://Alms">alms</A> and food were distributed, they eventually became hospitals.
Ambler	A saddle horse, distinct form a <A href="bword://Courser">courser</A> , <A href="bword://Destrier, Dextrarius">destrier</A> or warhorse.
Amorette	A love-knot interlaced like a rosette.
Anneal	The process of softening metal. For ferrous metals, that is those containing <A href="bword://iron">iron</A> , the process involves heating the <A href="bword://steel">steel</A> up to its critcal temperature and then slowly cooling it. For non-ferrous metals such as brass, <A href="bword://bronze">bronze</A> , silver, gold, aluminum and the like, the process is exactly opposite. The metal is heated to the critical temperature and then quickly quenched in water, snow, urine, or oil. What annealing actually does on a molecular level is to allow the metal crystals to realign, moving them into their more relaxed state. When the metal is worked, the crystals are moved out of alignment, contributing to both hardness and brittleness. Practically, in the production of arms and armour the metal must be annealed as it is worked, otherwise the metal might stress enough that it will crack.
Anoint	The holy element of a <A href="bword://Coronation">coronation</A> ceremony where holy oils were applied to the heir's body (usually the head) to seal the divine nature of the kingship.<BR>- <A href="http://www.chronique.com/Library/Knights/coronation.htm#anoint">15th century coronation ceremony</A>
Antioch, Battle of|Antioch|Battle of Antioch	28 June 1098. The most famous battle of the first <A href="bword://Crusade">crusade</A> , the beseiged <A href="bword://Crusader">crusaders</A> , inside of Antioch, sallied forth arranged into six divisions, defeating their <A href="bword://Saracen">Saracen</A> attackers in a brutal engagement, were the heavy cavalry of the knights, using cohesion in a frontal charge, shattered the bulk of Kerbogha’s army. Present at the battle was Godrey de Bouillon, one of the <A href="bword://Nine Worthies">nine worthies</A> .
Anueal	See <A href="bword://Anneal">Anneal</A>
Appatis	An agreement between the local citizenry of a defeated region and the occupying soldiery. Essentially a payment system that under the laws of war forbade theft and mistreatment of the locals so long as the appatisized country paid the ransom.
Apprentice	The first rung on the <A href="bword://Guild">guild</A> structure ladder. An apprentice served his master for numerous years, generally seven or more, to work of the debt of his training. Following a successful apprenticeship, the apprentice became a <A href="bword://Journeyman">journeyman</A> , eventually working to try to become a <A href="bword://Master">Master</A> of his craft.
Arbalest	(Fr: arbalète, Ger. Armbrust, Crossbow) The correct term for a crossbow, introduced early in the 14th century. The crossbow consisted of a bow mounted on a stock that could be cranked or pulled into place using more leverage than could be used on a conventional longbow. The result was a very high-powered, lower trajectoried weapon of great destructive potential. It fired a <A href="bword://Bolts, crossbow">bolt</A> , a shorter version of an arrow. However, the firing time on a crossbow was slow compared to the longbow, and for that reason and owing to the vastly higher expense during the period, the longbow remained the favored missile weapon of the 14th and 15th century in England and in France. From time to time the crossbow was banned by various laws, but it remained a weapon of great popularity during the late 14th century in the low countries, the Swiss states, in Germany and in Italy.
Arbalestier	A crossbowman or wielder of a <A href="bword://arbalest">arbalest</A> . During the 14th century they generally wore a <A href="bword://mail">mail</A> hauberk to defend the body, a <A href="bword://bascinet">bascinet</A> to defend the head, sometimes with a <A href="bword://Gorge, gorget, collar">collarette</A> of <A href="bword://iron">iron</A> to defend the throat. Almost always a footman, the crossbowman sometimes wore a <A href="bword://surcoat">surcoat</A> bearing the livery of affiliation. During the 15th century the hauberk was generally replaced with a <A href="bword://brigandine">brigandine</A> and the use of a <A href="bword://pavaise">pavaise</A> , a head-to-tow shield, was often brought out as a semi-portable defense that the man could hide behind as he reloaded so that he would not be cut down by arrows, other crossbow bolts, or by charging horsemen.
Arch-Duke	Title for the <A href="bword://Duke">dukes</A> of Austria, Lorraine, and Brabant, There is an informal <A href="bword://Society for Creative Anachronism (SCA)">SCA</A> meaning for this term usually construed to mean a ‘duke’ who was reigned more than five times.
Archer	A man wielding a bow, an early form of artillery used with great effect during the <A href="bword://Hundred Years War">Hundred Years War</A> by Edward III. Most archers of the 14th century were armed with a padded <A href="bword://jupon">jupon</A> , <A href="bword://mail">mail</A> shirt, or light <A href="bword://brigandine">brigandine</A> . Some also carried light <A href="bword://sword">swords</A> and <A href="bword://helmet">helmets</A> such as the <A href="bword://chapel de fer">chapel de fer</A> , but the majority were probably barely able to field more than themselves, a knife, and their bow / quiver of arrows. Gradually replaced during the 15th century by the <A href="bword://Arbalestier">Arbalestier</A> (crossbowman) and in the 16th century by the rifleman and cannon, the use of archers was a first step towards combined arms in an era dominated by heavy cavalary. Masses archers could destroy a mounted unit of cavalry or infantry if they could get in enough volleys before being crushed underhoof.
Argent	<A href="bword://Heraldry and Heralds">Heraldic</A> for silver or white, a <A href="bword://Metal">metal</A> , along with gold (<A href="bword://Or">or</A> ).
Arm Harness|Harness	All of the elements used in the defense of the arm. Under the armour might be an <A href="bword://aketon">aketon</A> or gambeson. Prior to the 14th century, the arm was defended by a <A href="bword://mail">mail</A> sleeve over an aketon. The early 14th century saw the enhancement of a <A href="bword://couter">couter</A> added to protect the elbow point. During the middle of the 14th century this couter was attached by <A href="bword://rivets">rivets</A> and <A href="bword://lames">lames</A> to the <A href="bword://vambrace">vambrace</A> which defended the lower arm and the <A href="bword://rerebrace">rerebrace</A> that defended the upper arm. Generally the resulting &quotarm harness," in one piece, was laced to the gambeson by a point from the top edge of the rerebrace at the outside of the arm. Over the rerebrace was then laid the <A href="bword://spaulder">spaulder</A> , a defense that covered the shoulder and uppermost arm. This piece was also laced to the gambeson by a point along the top edge. This defense remained more or less constant during the 15th century, except that the <A href="bword://wing">wing</A> was expanded in size to cover more of the inside of the elbow and the spaulder was sometimes expanded to become more cumbersome but more protective <A href="bword://pauldron">pauldron</A> . During this period reinforces were sometimes fitted to the couter to enhance the protection for the joust. The 16th century saw an explosion of this kind of defense, but it was used only in the joust. Also during the 16th century, the size on the couter wing was reduced again and there was a brief flirtation with articulation on the inside of the elbow joint. Major Developments during the 14th century<BR>- 1300 three-piece <A href="bword://vambrace">vambrace</A> , <A href="bword://couter">couter</A> , and <A href="bword://rerebrace">rerebrace</A> dominate early experimentation with arm defenses. German and Italians use <A href="bword://splinted defense">splinted defenses</A> frequently, and examples in both countries often retain the three piece model even after the splinted defenses have been supplanted by plate. Italian, English and French development followed the following points, though there too the simpler three-piece model is sometimes found for the duration of the period.<BR>- 1320 Earliest known defense known from the effigy of Don Alvéro de Cabrera in the Monastery of Santa Maria de Belpuig, Bellaguer, Spain. A splinted defense, three part construction.<BR>- 1325-1330 <A href="bword://Vambrace">Vambrace</A> begins to be constructed in two parts, hinged and secured with <A href="bword://buckles">buckles</A> .<BR>- 1330s on small plates defended the shoulder points, as found at Wisby and shown on contemporary effigies. These were often attached to the <A href="bword://brigandine">brigandine</A> defenses or to the <A href="bword://gambeson">gambeson</A> itself.<BR>- 1330s Laminated spaulder shown on Ifield, Sussex (England), reinforced with disks bearing a lion mask, the same being attached to the <a href="bword://couter">couters</A> .<BR>- 1335 <a href="bword://Lames">Lames</A> and <a href="bword://couter">couter</A> articulated in English examples <BR>- 1340 Fully articulated arm harness in plate appears in England (see Clehonger, Herefordshire) <BR>- <a href="bword://Rerebrace">Rerebrace</A> fully enclosed<BR>- <a href="bword://Vambrace">Vambrace</A> fully enclosed <BR>- <a href="bword://Spaulder">Spaulder</A> formed in lames extends down the arm, permanently attached to the <a href="bword://rerebrace">rerebrace</A> <BR>- Couter often formed of smaller plates, rather than the pointed variety. Often rounded in shape. <BR>- 1350 <a href="bword://besagews">besagews</A> disappear completely (<a href="bword://Arm Harness-Cont.">More...</A> )<BR>
Arm Harness-Cont.	- 1360 <a href="bword://Couter">Couter</A> is pointed in shape and is generally articulated with two or three <a href="bword://lames">lames</A> , but sometimes no lames are present, generally attributed to Italian workshops as opposed to the German method of attaching the couter via internal leather straps.<BR>- 1360 Disc-shaped couter <a href="bword://wing">wings</A> give way to heart-shaped wings.<BR>- 1360 Tulip-shaped <a href="bword://vambrace">vambraces</A> formed in Italian examples, bulging to match the form of the forearm muscle and flared to accommodate the wrist.<BR>- ~1360s developed the sliding <a href="bword://vambrace">vambrace</A> that could turn in the articulation to accommodate a greater range of arm movement and a reinforce was sometimes added to the vambrace just ahead of the <a href="bword://couter">couter</A> <BR>- ~1395 development of the <a href="bword://pauldron">pauldron</A> , where the <a href="bword://spaulder">spaulder</A> was enlarged to cover more of the armpit and part of the back and chest.<BR><BR>
Arm, defense of|defense of Arm	(see <A href="bword://Arm Harness">Arm Harness</A> )
Arma Patrina	(Latin): <A href="bword://Squire">Squires</A> who had either grown too old to qualify for <A href="bword://Knighthood">knighthood</A> or who had forgone the expense of knighthood but who were allowed to carry a <A href="bword://Lance (weapon used in the joust)">lance</A> and <A href="bword://Shield (construction of)">shield</A> even though these were generally restricted by the customs of war to the <A href="bword://Chivalry, the">chivalry</A> .
Armbrust	(Ger. for crossbow, see <A href="bword://Arbalest">Arbalest</A> )
Armed at all points	Ready for tourney or battle.
Armed to all rights	Completely armed, fully equipped, ready for battle.
Armet (à rondel)|Armet|a rondel|rondel|à rondel	The dominant helmet during much of the 15th century, the Armet gradually evolved into the first truly international style of helmet, the close helmet. Armets were built of a snug-fitting bowl that came to just above the ears, fitted with cheek plates that attached by hinges to this bowl. Usually the chin pieces clasp in the front and secure in the back along a strip of <A href="bword://steel">steel</A> that extends from the shallow skull bowl. The bowl itself is often reinforced with an additional layer of steel across the brow, and a <A href="bword://visor">visor</A> fills in around the nose and eyes to make an exceptionally functional closed helmet. For some unknown reason, a disc of metal was sometimes attached to the back of these helmets; the purpose of this <A href="bword://rondel">rondel</A> is unknown. The armet succeeded the <A href="bword://bascinet">bascinet</A> as the most common helmet in Europe, taking elements from the <A href="bword://great bascinet">great bascinet</A> . They were exceedingly popular in Italy, France and England, while the Sallet enjoyed great popularity in those regions and also in the German lands as well.
Armiger	The Norman predecessor of what came to be known as <A href="bword://Squire">squire</A> , young men who were in training to be <A href="bword://Knight">knights</A> , a term popular during the 13th century. See also <A href="http://www.chronique.com/Chronique/chrniq08.htm">Chronique: The Journal of Chivalry #8</A> .
Arming Cap	A small quilted cap worn under the <A href="bword://mail">mail</A> coif that offered protection against blows and the friction of mail against the head. They seem to have fallen out of use by the beginning of the 14th century.
Arming Coat	(See <A href="bword://Aketon">Aketon</A> )
Arming Nail	A word for <A href="bword://rivets">rivet</A> used in the making or repair of armour.
Arming Points	<A href="bword://Leather">Leather</A> discs attached to armour so that it could be laced to the <A href="bword://gambeson">gambeson</A> , hauberk, or another piece of armour. Generally these pieces of leather were relatively thin and flexible and featured two holes to allow a lacing to pass through and be tied off.
Arming Squire	The <A href="bword://Squire">squire</A> whose duties included accompanying his <A href="bword://Knight">knight</A> to war, caring for his gear, and helping him to put on his armour. Generally a five year <A href="bword://Apprentice">apprenticeship</A> from age 13 to 18. Sometimes the arming squires would accompany their knight as part of his <A href="bword://Lance (unit organization)">lance</A> , or household unit. These duties are distinguished from the squire of the table, whose duties were generally held to dressing the knight and serving at table, functions for younger squires and sometimes by <A href="bword://Page">pages</A> . There is not always a clear distinction between the two. See also <A href="http://www.chronique.com/Chronique/chrniq08.htm">Chronique: The Journal of Chivalry #8</A> .
Armorica	Ancient name ‘on the sea’ in the Breton language, often confused with Amonica in Northern Wales. Geoffrey of Monmouth made this error, placing the events of King Arthur on the continent rather than in Wales, where they make more sense.
Armory	A place for storing weapons and <A href="bword://Armour (Armor)">armour</A> . Sometimes this can mean a royal storehouse, as in the <A href="bword://Tower of London">Royal Armouries in the Tower of London</A> or in <A href="bword://Gratz Armoury">Gratz</A> , Austria, or more generally any storehouse in a <A href="bword://Castle">castle</A> or stronghold. It can also mean a workshop in which arms are made or repaired, and lastly, the correct term for all things relating to a <A href="bword://Heraldry and Heralds">herald</A> . In modern usage armories repair and build firearms.
Armour (Armor)|Armor|Armour	The defense of the knight against the weapons of his opponents, consisting of his complete <A href="bword://harness">harness</A> . Often this was used only to denote the &quothard" bits of the harness, the hardened <A href="bword://leather">leather</A> or plate defenses, rather than the softer arming garments, though sometimes layered cloth was also used as the sole defense, as in a <A href="bword://jupon">jupon</A> . I use the English spelling with the "-our" rather than the Americanized version to denote the difference between modern armored combat vehicles (e.g. tanks) and armour that is meant for the individual medieval soldier.
Armour, as insurance|Armour as insurance	Killing knights who were opponents was not necessarily the rule in medieval conflicts. In war, a knight wearing an expensive <a href="bword://harness">harness</A> might well be captured rather than killed both because knights tended to see themselves as a more or less homogeneous, almost brotherly class, and also because a rich suit of armour indicated that the knight had money-it was more in the financial interest of the capturing knight to take him alive and demand a ransom than to slay him outright and lose the ransom. Fine armour and horse both contributed to communicating this intent on the battlefield, though it was not always effective, as at Agincourt when more than 1,500 knights were slain outright following the battle. <BR><BR>
Armour, buying|buying Armour	During the high middle ages, armour could be purchased from guild members in major cities, retrieved from less fortunate men-at-arms from battlegrounds, or imported from armouring centers, especially in Italy and Germany, both very high quality production centers during the period. Modern collectors and re-enactors have two main options. They can purchase real pieces from auction houses such as Sotheby's or Christies, or they can order reproduction pieces from the thriving artists working with tournament societies all over the world. If you are buying armour to use in a tournament re-enactment, be sure that you tell the <a href="bword://armourer">armourer</A> what use you intend to put the armour to so that appropriate safety standards can be met.

Armour, decoration of|Armour decoration|decoration of Armour	Medieval armour, even armour meant for war, was often decorated when the knight was wealthy enough to pay the enormous costs associated with such embellishment.

There is some evidence that forge-welding was being done during the 14th century; work done by the Swiss Institute of Arms and Armour in Granscay, Switzerland has published some excellent research on this. A modern student of armour who wants to get started should invest first in research books, to begin to train his eye; next in basic hammers, stakes and vices; then later in finish and welding equipment.

Armourer (Armorer)|Armorer|Armourer	The artist/craftsman responsible for creating armour. In the 14th and 15th centuries armouring was a highly sought after family business, where carefully guarded techniques made for a good deal of secrecy and national jealousy. Families such as the <A href="bword://Missiglia, armourer family">Missiglian</A> and the Negroli and the Seusenhofers kept a huge industry alive for more than two centuries. Modern schools of armouring have produced similar stylistic families, with the <A href="bword://Valerius School">&quotValerius School"</A> being the most prolific across the U.S.. We use the English spelling "-our" to distinguish from the kind of armorer who works on firearms who is a machinist-engineer/artist rather than a silver-/blacksmith / artist. See also <A href="http://www.chronique.com/Library/Glossaries/glossary-AA/www.chronique.com/Chronique/chrniq06.htm">Chronique: The Journal of Chivalry #6</A> .
Armourer's Mark	The stamp that was placed on a piece of armour to signify the maker, much like a hallmark that is still used on jewelry. Sometimes three or four master's marks appear on a given piece, especially in the Italian examples where armour shops often had two or three armourers working on different aspects of the <A href="bword://harness">harness</A> . Journeymen and apprentices do not seem to have had their own marks, and sometimes a family or guild mark is included as a statement of quality. <BR>In England there remain from the 14th century statutes that delineate which armour may be stamped and sold within London and which cannot. The city guild seems to have held a strong control over the import/export market by this &quotquality" filter that could be conveniently applied to reduce imports or restrict unguilded craftsmen. See <A href="http://www.chronique.com/Library/Glossaries/glossary-AA/www.chronique.com/Chronique/chrniq06.htm">Chronique: The Journal of Chivalry #6</A> .
Armourer, art of the|art of the Armourer	The ability to go beyond the craft of armour creation and to make an artistic statement that is communicated to the viewer through the piece.

Arms	Weapons or <A href="bword://Armour (Armor)">armour</A> , or a heraldic <A href="bword://Device (heraldic)">device</A> .
Arpent	A unit of measure mentioned in the <A href="bword://Star, Order of the">Star’s</A> charter--‘knights of the star shall never flee more than 40 arpents from a battle....’
Arrière-Guard|Arriere-Guard	The rear-guard in a 14th century army. The leading division was known as the <a href="bword://Avant-Guard">avant-guard</A> <BR>
Arrow-slit	The narrow opening in a <A href="bword://Castle">castle</A> wall, a window, through which <A href="bword://Archer">archers</A> could shoot but still have substantial cover. The inside of the opening was often tapered to allow the archer a larger field of fire.
Arsouf, Battle of|Battle of Arsouf	Richard the Lionheart and Saladin fought this important battle in 1191, as Richard needed a port to conduct his operations at sea.
Art of Courtly Love, The|Courtly Love|The Art of Courtly Love	Written by Andreas Cappallanus between 1174 and 1186 for Marie de Champagne. The work speaks of the relations between the sexes, parodying Ovid's <I>Art of Love</I>. He provided 31 rules for loving, Amongst his dialogues and advice, he offered the following: 1. Marriage is no real excuse for not loving.<BR>2. He who is not jealous cannot love.<BR>5. That which a lover takes against the will of his beloved has no relish.<BR>11. It is not proper to love any woman whom one would be ashamed to seek to marry.<BR>12. A true lover does not desire to embrace anyone in love except his beloved.<BR>13. When made public love rarely endures.<BR>15. Every lover regularly turns pale in the presence of his beloved.<BR>24. Every act of a lover ends in the thought of his beloved.<BR>26. Love can deny nothing to love.<BR>27. A lover can never have enough of the solaces of his love.<BR>28. Nothing forbids one woman from being loved by two men or one man by two women. <BR>Certainly these rules strike us as odd today; their impact on the morality of the 12th century was even more risqué. The Courts of Love held by Countess Marie, the countesses of Norbonne and Flanders and Eleanor of Aquitaine were renowned for their amusements; indeed the ideals of courtly love, while extreme, bore a mark in the <A href="bword://Chivalry">chivalric ideals</A> later expressed in the <A href="bword://Romances">romances</A> , which in their turn, impacted on the expectations society held for knightly conduct.
Articulation	The technique for joining plates together using <A href="http://www.chronique.com/Library/Glossaries/glossary-AA/arms_r.htm#rivets">rivets</A> . In order to work properly, the rivets must be nearly parallel and optimally opposite one another to work. Frequently, poor articulation is the reason that many reproduction <A href="bword://harness">harnesses</A> might look like the real thing but don't move like them. It is one of the more difficult arts for the <A href="http://armourer (Armorer)">armourer</A> to learn. Plates that articulate together should not produce gaps, places where weapons might force their way in, where pieces can freeze in an awkward position (it happens!) or come apart. Much more difficult than it sounds....
Artillator	Maker of bows, arrows, and other archery goods.
Artillery	Technically the use of heavy missiles, during the bulk of the Middle Ages the role of artillery was confined to use in the <A href="bword://Siege">siege</A> . During the 14th century, however, the English under the generalship of Edward III experimented with combined arms using artillery in the form of <A href="bword://Archer">archers</A> , <A href="bword://Infantry">infantry</A> and <A href="bword://Cavalry">cavalry</A> with devastating effect. <A href="bword://Cannon">Cannons</A> were known as early as 1300, their presence is noted in many sieges, such as at Harfleur and Edward’s siege of <A href="bword://Calais">Calais</A> in 1346, but until the early 16th century they had little effect on the battlefield proper. During the 18th century the devastating effect of artillery gave it the nickname it still carries to the current day, ‘Queen of the Battlefield.’
Arçon|Arcon	A saddle-bow, the piece rising in the front of the saddle.
Ascalon, Battle of|Ascalon|Battle of Ascalon	14 August 1099. Open field encounter between El-Afdal of Egypt and the crusaders of Duke Godfrey de Bouillon. Godfrey’s genius for maneuver rocked the <A href="bword://Saracen">Saracen</A> army, forcing it back onto itself, into the sea, and up into sycamore trees where many of them were burned to death. A huge amount of booty was taken from the Saracen baggage train, including the vizier’s banner, sword and armour. Scabbling over the booty kept the crusaders from seizing the town of Ascalon, but it earned a poor renown for the Egyptians that was recovered only at the Battle of Ramelah a few years later.
Ash, as a material for lances|Ash|Ash as a material for lances|material for lances	Several chronicles mention that ash was used as the material for <A href="bword://lance">lances</A> and <A href="bword://pike">pikes</A> , because of its resilient quality and ease of availability in western Europe.
Assassins|Assassin	A radical sect of Muslim shi-ites organized in the late 11th century to fight the opponents of Ismali by any means possible. Known to fortify themselves for their work using Hashishin--‘hashish’, they came to be known in French as assassins, and the name became synomynous with plotted murder. The followers had a stronghold near Antioch under the leadership of Sinan Ibn Salman Ibn Muhummad, called Rashid ad-Din, the Old Man of the Mountain. In 1192 they murdered Conrad of Montferrat, supposedly at the behest of Richard Lionheart, but this charge was disproved. See also <A href="http://www.chronique.com/Chronique/chrniq09.htm">Chronique: The Journal of Chivalry #9</A> .
Atteint	A common 15th century term used to determine a hit in a <A href="bword://Joust">joust</A> .
Avalon, Isle of|Avalon|Isle of Avalon	Associated with the Isle of Man in the Irish Sea, the isle is often associated with <A href="bword://Glastonbury">Glastonbury</A> , where the body of King Arthur was said to rest.
Avant-Guard	The first division in a 14th century army, also known as the ‘vanguard’. The rear-guard was known as the <A href="http://www.chronique.com/Library/Glossaries/glossary-KCT/gloss_a.htm#arriere-guard">arrière-guard</A>.
Aventail	A skirt of <A href="bword://mail">mail</A> attached to a <A href="bword://bascinet">bascinet</A> or <A href="bword://armet">armet</A> during the 14th and 15th centuries. It <A href="bword://neck, defense of">defends the neck</A> from attack, usually hanging to at least 1" below the shoulder point for bascinets. Generally it was attached to a <A href="bword://leather">leather</A> cuff that wrapped around the base of the bascinet and up the cheeks, which was pierced with holes and laced to the helmet through <A href="bword://vervelles">vervelles</A> .
Azure	<A href="bword://Heraldry and Heralds">Heraldic</A> for ‘blue.’
Babieca	The steed of El Cid.
Bacele	Ten <A href="bword://Lance (unit organization)">lances</A> of <A href="bword://Cavalry">cavalry</A> forming a division of approximately 600 <A href="bword://Knight">knights</A> .
Bachelier	Bachelor <A href="bword://Knight">knight</A> . Before a knight settled and attracted followers, they held the rank of bachelier. They might then go out at war or <A href="bword://Tournament (Tournoi)">tourney</A> or just adventuring, similar to the <A href="bword://Errant">errant</A> knight of romantic history. See also knight <A href="bword://Bannerette, banneret">banneret</A> .
Backplate	Armour for the back. See the particular kinds of <A href="bword://breastplate">breastplate</A> , <A href="bword://brigandine">brigandines</A> , <A href="bword://cuirass">cuirasses</A> and <A href="bword://Cote of Plates, Pair of Plates, Plates">coats of plates</A> for a more detailed description.
Badge	A mark of distinction, similar to a <A href="bword://Cote of Arms">coat of arms</A> , a supplemental charge often used to mark military units or other more informal groups of soldiers or <A href="bword://Household knights">household</A> members. Feudal <A href="bword://Lord">lords</A> often gave household badges to their men, tokens of cloth or, more elaborately, of jewelry worn as a mark of distinction to identify them with the <A href="bword://Nobility">noble</A> .
Bailey	A <A href="bword://Palisade">palisaded</A> enclosure, part of early <A href="bword://Castle">castles</A> , any area surrounded by a walled enclosure designed to provide defense. See also <A href="bword://Ward">ward</A> .
Bailiff	An outsider frequently employed by a feudal <A href="bword://Lord">lord</A> to look after his estates. Such men collected rents, managed the production of the holdings, protecting the lord’s interests on the estate in his role as freeman. Once per year an audit would generally be held, to be certain that the bailiff, a man of great power in the absence of the rightful lord, would be checked. Because of the potential for treachery, larceny, and abuse, bailiffs were generally very well paid.
Bailiwick	The area of responsibility for a <A href="bword://Sheriff">sheriff</A> , responsible for keeping the peace and for enforcing the royal laws.
Baleyn	A medieval word for the <A href="bword://Whalebone, evidence for use as a tourney weapon">whalebone</A> used for weapons and armour during the 14th century.
Balinger	A small <A href="bword://Galley">galley</A> able to maneuver on rivers and, in the later middle ages, known for speed, used as a small warship.
Banda, Order of the|Banda|Order of the Banda	{}
Bandorelle	A small streamer attached to the head of a <A href="bword://Lance (weapon used in the joust)">lance</A> , called a ‘pencil’ in English.
Banner	A <A href="bword://Knight">knight</A> who led a significant number of troops into battle was entitled to carry a banner. This banner, emblazoned with his <A href="bword://Device (heraldic)">device</A> or a <A href="bword://Badge">badge</A> or a recognizable symbol, was useful for rallying troops inn the confusion of battle. The form of the banner was largely dependent upon the rank of the knight and size of his contingent. Knights with small <A href="bword://Household knights">household</A> units, called <A href="bword://Lance (unit organization)">lances</A> or on their own typically bore a small triangular <A href="bword://Pennant">pennant</A> rather than a banner. Knights with larger groups were known as knights <A href="bword://Bannerette, banneret">banneret</A> , a rank that seems to have been vaguely formalized during the 14th century. See <A href="http://www.chronique.com/Chronique/chrniq11.htm">Chronique: The Journal of Chivalry #11</A> .
Bannerette, banneret|Bannerette|banneret	The rank of a <A href="bword://Knight">knight</A> just above the <A href="bword://Bachelier">bachelier</A> , or bachelor knight. The knight banneret was a unit leader of a group larger than a <A href="bword://Lance (unit organization)">lance</A> (ten or less).
Banners Displayed	To declare open warfare against one’s <A href="bword://Liege">liege</A> lord, as in the 1322 incident when Roger Damory was accused of such in a <A href="bword://Court of Chivalry">Court of Chivalry</A> (though it was not called that at that time) under the <A href="bword://Constable">constable</A> and <A href="bword://Marshal">marshal</A> .
Bannockburn, Battle of|Bannockburn|Battle of Bannockburn	The battle near Stirling, 23 June 1314, where the English, commanded by Edward II, was defeated by Robert Bruce, king of Scotland. The English set out to relieve Stirling castle, but the English cavalry, met by the Scots in the Forth Valley plain. Both sides prepared for a morning battle. The Scots, using <A href="bword://Spear">spears</A> , managed to catch the English <A href="bword://Cavalry">cavalry</A> between the two rivers and cut to pieces. Only Berwick remained in English hands; the legend of Robert the Bruce carrying Scotland closer to independence.
Bans	A public announcement or proclamation, ‘bans’ were often ‘cried’ for an upcoming marriage in order to provide time for any objectors to come forward. Often the bans were cried 30 days in advance. For tournaments, bans were often issued telling of the time and place of the tournament. See <A href="bword://Cry the Tournament">Cry the Tournament</A> .
Bar	In <A href="bword://Heraldry and Heralds">heraldry</A> , an ordinary stripe, crossing the center of the heraldic <A href="bword://Field">field</A> in a horizontal manner. Normally it occupies 1/3 of the <A href="bword://Shield (construction of)">shield</A> .
Barbican	An approach to a town or <A href="bword://Castle">castle</A> which is defended by a field of fire from one or more towers, generally two. The barbican itself, an outcropping from the <A href="bword://Gatehouse">gatehouse</A> , allowed approach to the gate only through a narrow, easily defended passage.
Barbute	The Italian helmet derived from the <A href="bword://bascinet">bascinet</A> recalling the Corinthian style helmets popular in the Greek empire. Characterized by a rounded skull; a &quott-shaped" opening for the face, sometimes expanded into a fully open face; a strongly <A href="bword://flaring">flared</A> tail and cheek pieces all executed to form a very elegant, flowing defense for the head. Early barbutes featured an open face, and can be found as early as 1410; usually they were restricted to the Italian peninsula or on armours intended for export by Italian armouries. They seem to have been made in Venice and in Milan-the finest examples are of the <A href="bword://Missiglia">Missiglian</A> school. Popular during the middle years of the 15th century, they were seen on the field either <A href="bword://Polish, finish appropriate for the 14th century">polished</A> or covered in cloth, sometimes velvet, which was in turn sometimes covered with chased bronze or <A href="bword://latten">latten</A> floral adornment.
Barded	An armoured warhorse.
Bardi	Florentine bankers who loaned the English crown money to support military operations from the late 13th century until the 1340s. Following Edward III’s default, the family went bankrupt within ten years.
Barding	The defense for the horse, sometimes referring to the armour and sometimes referring to the cloth decoration that served to identify the owner. During the 14th century armour for the horse seems to have been usually restricted to the <A href="bword://chamfron">chamfron</A> for the head and the <A href="bword://crinet">crinet</A> for the neck, but there are also references to <A href="bword://cuirboille">cuirboille</A> armours. No armour from this period has survived, sadly. During the 15th century, as the knight himself adopted the full <A href="bword://white armour">white harness</A> , the horse was also sometimes fully armoured. See especially the very fine example of a German <A href="bword://gothic armour">&quotgothic" harness</A> in the <A href="bword://Wallace Collection">Wallace Collection, London</A> .
Barge	A medium-sized sea-vessel. See also <A href="bword://Ships">Ships</A> .
Bargello Collection|Bargello	The armour collection in Venice, Italy, featuring many fine <A href="bword://barbute">barbutes</A> , <A href="bword://bascinet">bascinets</A> , and in particular a very fine set of <A href="bword://gauntlet">gauntlets</A> that are a match to the <A href="bword://Churburg #13">Churburg #13</A> harness, the first homogeneous harness known. These gauntlets feature latten work on the <A href="bword://cuff">cuff</A> , <A href="bword://metacarpal">metacarpal</A> , and along the edge of the gauntlet. They are without question the finest examples known of 14th century gauntlets. Website at <A href="http://www.thais.it/scultura/fmndb.htm">http://www.thais.it/scultura/fmndb.htm</A>
Barnet, Battle of|Barnet|Battle of Barnet	Important battle in the <A href="bword://Wars of the Roses">Wars of the Roses</A> , in which Richard Neville, the ‘<A href="bword://Kingmaker">Kingmaker</A> ’, was slain on 14 April, 1471. Edward IV’s victorious troops destroyed their opponents, slaying a reported 30,000.
Baron	After 1066, the tenants-in-chief who held their lands directly from the <A href="bword://King">king</A> . Gradually, a distinction between the greater and lesser barons emerged, so that by the late 13th century the greater barons began to attend <A href="bword://Parliament (English)">Parliament</A> under summons from the king. The first use of the style ‘baron’ in an individual’s name came in 1387. The Baron ranks in precedence below a <A href="bword://Count">count</A> , carrying the title ‘<A href="bword://Excellency, Your">your excellency</A> .’ <BR>In the <A href="bword://Society for Creative Anachronism (SCA)">SCA</A> , a Baron is a regional <A href="bword://Lord">lord</A> responsible for a unit, generally a city. ‘Landed’ barons are thus attached to a city, responsible for the administration and maintenance of those lands. <A href="bword://Court Baron">'Court' barons</A> have no such land, and are granted the title as a courtesy grant, usually for service to the <A href="bword://Crown">Crown</A> or <A href="bword://Kingdom, SCA">kingdom</A> .
Baroness	Wife of a <A href="bword://Baron">Baron</A> or a woman who held a barony in her own right; in literature ‘baroness’ generally refers to a holder in her own right, while the title ‘lady’ is reserved for Barons’ wives.
Baronet	A post-medieval title created by James I on May 22, 1611, ranking below a <A href="bword://Peer">peer</A> and above a <A href="bword://Knight">knight</A> .
Barrel	A measure for dry-goods-- <BR>Ale - 32 gallons<BR>Beer - 36 gallons<BR>Wine - 31.5 gallons<BR>Herring or Eels - 30 gallons fully packed<BR>Salmon - 42 gallons<BR>Butter - 256 lbs<BR>Soup - 280 lbs

Bascinet	The helmet that evolved out of the <A href="bword://Cervèllaire">cervellaire</A> , a small &quotskull cap" worn under the <A href="bword://great helm">great helm</A> , by extending the plate down over the neck and cheeks. Gradually the great helm was discarded altogether in favor of the bascinet because of the superior vision, glancing surface, and lightweight design. Early bascinets had no <A href="bword://visor">visors</A> , but by the second quarter of the 14th century they were fitted with <A href="bword://Klappvisier">Klappvisiers</A> , visors, using a centralized hinge system. Many of these hinges were easily removed, possibly meaning that they were intended to be discarded after the battle was joined. During the 1370s visors began to be attached to the side of the helmet, a more secure attachment system that often allowed the visor to pivot completely back around the helmet, meaning that it might not be lost in battle. During the 1390s <A href="bword://steel">steel</A> <A href="bword://ventail">ventails</A> gradually replaced the <A href="bword://mail">mail</A> <A href="bword://aventail">aventail</A> that had been fitted alongside the klappvisier to <A href="bword://neck, defense of">defend the neck</A> , creating a new kind of helmet, the <A href="bword://great bascinet">great bascinet</A> , popular especially in the <A href="bword://Hundred Years War">Hundred Years War</A> in both France and England. Many examples can be seen in funery effigies of the period. This innovation of hinged neck defenses gradually evolved into the <A href="http://www.chronique.com/Library/Glossaries/glossary-AA/arms_a.htm#armet">Armet</A> , the dominant helmet of the 15th century. The bascinet itself was popular throughout Europe during the 14th century, showing a great variety of forms within the style. It is now the most popular helmet in the SCA because of the pronounced glancing surface, ease with which a grille may be attached and interchanged with a visor, superior defense for the head and neck, and sleek appearance.

Besagews	Small round <A href="bword://shield (construction of)">&quotshields"</A> that were laced to the <A href="bword://mail">mail</A> at the shoulder to defend the armpit. Developed as augmentation to mail defenses in the late 13th century, they faded in popularity during the first half of the 14th century, disappearing completely by 1350 as <A href="bword://spaulder">spaulders</A> began to serve the same purpose while at the same time defending the shoulder joint itself. During the latter half of the 15th century they made a comeback, added occasionally to tourney <A href="bword://garniture">garnitures</A> during the early 16th century.

The series was immensely popular with tournament re-enactors.
Black armour, evidence for|Black armour|evidence for Black armour	There seems to be some grounds to the rumor that the armour of Edmund, Prince of Wales, was actually finished with a black <A href="http://www.chronique.com/Library/Glossaries/glossary-AA/arms_p.htm#polish, 14th century">polish</A> . Although he was not given the name &quotthe Black Prince" until after his death, it is possible that this represents a finish used during the 14th century. However, there are hundreds of manuscript illustrations from the 14th century, and they almost always depict the armour as satin or gloss finished. <BR>During the 15th century black finishes on armour become commonplace in manuscript illustrations, although it is unclear whether this is paint or some kind of controlled oxidation process. Modern <A href="bword://armourer">armourers</A> have used black oxide finishes done through commercial houses to approximate this effect, but I have only seen one actual piece with something approaching this finish, a <A href="bword://gothic armour">gothic composite harness</A> held in the <A href="bword://Metropolitan Museum of Art">Metropolitan Museum of Art</A> , C. 1480 or so. I do not know whether the finish is original or not. It is also possible that this is a rough finish direct from the <A href="bword://Hammer (armourer's tool)">hammer</A> or from heat treating, left on low-quality munitions pieces to reduce costs.
Black Death	The plague, believed to have been bubonic plague, swept western and central Europe several times during the 14th century, killing 1/3 of the population of 20 million people. In addition to the social and personal upheaval the plague brought, it also destroyed the economy of the areas struck, increasing the price of labor and reducing the value of land.
Blanc	14th century French silver coin.
Blanchart	A common French name for a white horse, found in many <A href="bword://Romances">romances</A> .
Blazon	The correct term for describing <A href="bword://Heraldry and Heralds">heraldic</A> arms in their armorial bearing.

Blood Channel,  Blood Groove|Blood Channel|Blood Groove	The erroneous name given to the <A href="bword://fuller">fuller</A> of a <A href="bword://sword">sword</A> blade by more fanciful modern writers.
Bloomery Process	Also known as the 'direct reduction' method of <A href="bword://smelting">smelting</A> <A href="bword://iron">iron</A> , this process was known from as early as 900 B.C. The ore is heated in a low, cylindrical shaft furnace, constructed of stone, fueled with charcoal, and fanned with a bellows to a temperature from 1100-1220 degrees C and reduced directly to a spongy lump, producing iron ore and large quantites of <A href="bword://slag">slag</A> . Though not discovered until the 15th century, this iron could be converted to <A href="bword://steel">steel</A> by leaving it within the furnace for a longer time, so that the iron spent more time in contact with carbon monoxide gas.
Body,  defense of|defense of Body	Prior to the late 13th century, the knight defended his body with a combination defense of <A href="bword://mail">mail</A> and underlying padded <A href="bword://aketon">aketon</A> . At the very end of the century we begin to find references to <A href="bword://Cote of Plates, Pair of Plates, Plates">cotes of plates</A> being occasionally worn in addition to the hauberk defense. By 1350 the cote of plates seems to have progressed more usually into a single globular defense, a <A href="bword://breastplate">breastplate</A> covered or <A href="bword://Polish, finish appropriate for the 14th century">polished</A> . By the end of the century, the breast and <A href="bword://backplate">backplate</A> had advanced to the point where they were fully encompassing, and with the addition of <A href="bword://Faulds">faulds</A> defended not only the body but the hips as well. During the 15th century this defense was refined only by degree; the basic solution derived in the latter 14th century served well until the second quarter of the 16th C.. <BR><BR>Major Developments during the 14th century<BR>- 1275-1350 The <A href="bword://Cote of Plates, Pair of Plates, Plates">cote of plates</A> features the use of several large plates <A href="bword://rivets">riveted</A> to the inside, or very occasionally, to the outside of a cloth covering.<BR>- 1335-1370 The globose <A href="bword://breastplate">breastplate</A> develops, at first covered with cloth but later a <A href="bword://Polish, finish appropriate for the 14th century">polished</A> piece of <A href="bword://iron">iron</A> in one or more (often 2) pieces. <A href="bword://Backplate">Backplates</A> still usually formed from several large plates covered in cloth.<BR>- 1350-1380 Guard chains sometimes attached from the <A href="bword://breastplate">breastplate</A> , <A href="bword://sword">sword</A> , dagger and helmet to prevent loss.<BR>- 1360-1400 <A href="bword://Brigandine">Brigandines</A> , derived from the <A href="bword://Cote of Plates, Pair of Plates, Plates">cote of plates</A> , also find wide use.

Book of the Courtier	The book by Baldasarre Castiglione that details a fictional discussion at the <A href="bword://Court">Court</A> of Urbino, northern Italy, between the Duchess of Urbino and various members of her court. In this discussion, the aspects of the perfect courtier are discussed in meticulous detail. It is an extremely valuable book, one that shows how the rough figure of the <A href="bword://Knight">knight</A> had, by the Renaissance, fully metamorphasized into the <A href="bword://Gentleman">gentleman</A> .
Book of the Order of Chivalry	William Caxton’s 1494 translation of Ramon Lull’s <B><I>Le Libre del Orde de Caualyeria</B></I>, in which a young <A href="bword://Squire">squire</A> . loses his way on his way to be knighted, meeting an old hermit, an ancient <A href="bword://Knight">knight</A> , who instructs him in the ways of <A href="bword://Chivalry">chivalry</A> , including the fanciful origins of the knight, his duties, virtues and vices, the symbolism of his weapons and armour, his customs, and the honor due a knight. Himself once a knight, Ramon Lull’s work stands as one of the finest works on chivalry, extant or known, as valuable as Geoffrey de Charnay’s <B><I>Livre Chevalerie</B></I> or the anonymous <B><I>Ordene de Chevalerie</B></I>. The book was immensely popular since it was first done in Catalan during the earliest years of the 14th century, after which it was translated into more than a dozen languages. See <a href="http://www.chronique.com/Chronique/chrniq08.htm">Chronique: The Journal of Chivalry #8</A> and the English translation done by the Chivalry Bookshelf.
Book of the Tournament	The book of essays on the <A href="bword://Tournament (Tournoi)">tournament</A> of <A href="bword://Chivalry">chivalry</A> by Brian Price, encompassing all aspects of the tournament in terms of philosophy and practice. It is the first modern ‘chivalry handbook’, done in something of the tradition of King René’s and Ramon Lull’s books. You can find <A href="http://www.chronique.com/Chronique/tbook.htm">details about the book</A> elsewhere on this website!.
Book on the Form and the Devising of a Tournament|Book of Tournament|Book on the Devising of a Tournament|Book on the Form of a Tournament	The most famous treatise on the <A href="bword://Tournament (Tournoi)">tournament</A> , written by René d’Anjou in the 15th century. The work describes what René conceived of as his ‘ideal’ tournament, though he intersperses his description of such a tournament with observations on <A href="bword://Arms">arms</A> &amp; <A href="bword://Armour (Armor)">armour</A> and the tournament customs of various countries of Europe. The original was done in French, reprinted in this century by B. Hersher, Paris, and translated into English by Dr. Elizabeth Bennett.
Booty	The right of a medieval soldier to <A href="bword://Ransom">ransoms</A> , riches and other <A href="bword://Armour (Armor)">armour</A> or horses available from a <A href="bword://Battle (bataille)">battle</A> . This was an important incentive since most medieval armies weren’t paid, at least not regularly, but it also proved a great problem because armies had a tendency to break up at the first chance for booty, such as during the Battle of Hastings or at the <A href="bword://Sack of Limoges">Sack of Limoges</A> .
Borough	Originally meaning a fortified town in England, the name came to indicate a town with a corporation of citizens and privileges conferred by Royal Charter. The markets and <A href="bword://Fair">faires</A> of the borough grew in importance during the Middle Ages, and gradually the boroughs elected their own members of <A href="bword://Parliament (English)">Parliament</A> .
Boroughbridge, Battle of|Battle of Boroughbridge|Boroughbridge	(1322) The <A href="bword://Battle (bataille)">battle</A> in Yorkshire in which Thomas, 2nd <A href="bword://Earl">Earl</A> of Lancaster was slain after a truce had been declared the night previously.
Bosson	A 'battering ram' designed to pound down the gate on a besieged castle.
Bosworth Field, Battle of|Battle of Bosworth Field|Bosworth Field	22 August 1485. <A href="bword://Battle (bataille)">Battle</A> which ended in the death of the last Plantagenet ruler, Richard III at the hand of Henry Tudor. Though Richard’s army was larger, morale was low. During the battle, troops of the Stanley family, hitherto loyal to the <A href="bword://King">king</A> , turned on Richard and slew his guard. It was at this battle that the famous Shakespeare line, ‘My horse—my kingdom for a horse!’ is about; Richard is said to have had his horse slain and, casting about for another, was unsuccessful, dying on foot.
Bouche	The small corner cut into the top of the <A href="bword://shield (construction of)">shield</A> to accommodate the <A href="bword://lance">lance</A> , not popular until the 15th century.
Bouging	The rough-finish process by which the larger lumps are taken out of a roughly shaped piece of armour left from <A href="bword://raising">raising</A> or <A href="bword://dishing">dishing</A> . It generally takes 500-1000 <A href="bword://Hammer (armourer's tool)">hammer</A> strokes to get a clean, bouged surface. Next the piece is <A href="bword://planishing">planished</A> , and finally <A href="bword://Polish, finish appropriate for the 14th century">polished</A> .
Bourdonasse	A long, elaborately painted <A href="bword://lance">lance</A> designed to splinter on contact in late joust over the <A href="bword://Barriers (combat over the)">barrier</A> .
Bout	A single fight, sometimes called a ‘pass’, generally a modern term used mostly in the <A href="bword://Society for Creative Anachronism (SCA)">SCA</A> and in other re-enactment groups.
Brass (funerary brass)|Brass|funerary brass	During the 14th and 15th centuries gisants or funerary brasses were often used as memorials for knights and their consorts. These plates were constructed in pieces of sheet brass and installed in the floor of a local church in remembrance of the knight's deeds. Often highly detailed, they are one of the better references for what armour looked like during the <A href="bword://transitional period">transitional period</A> , when few actual examples of the armour have survived. One must use caution when dating armour using a funerary brass, however, because a knight was generally depicted in his own <A href="bword://harness">harness</A> , which might be as much as forty years out of date at the time of his death. In modern times, these brasses have been the base upon which the popular brass rubbings are made, a process by which a wax crayon is used to take an impression of the knight. Many English and French churches produce income by selling finished rubbings of the brasses in their floors or sell the components and allow tourists to take their own rubbings.
Bratasche, breteche|Bratasche|breteche	The wooden covering placed over a wall during war to protect the archers and soldiers from attack, generally a defense dismantled during peacetime.
Breastplate	Originally evolving out of the <A href="bword://Cote of Plates, Pair of Plates, Plates">cote of plates</A> as the size on each individual plate increased and the front plate was increasingly globular, the breastplate was fully formed by 1360 or so but was not in wide use until the 1380s. This globular design provided an effective glancing surface that deflected both hand and missile weapons. During the 1360-1400 period it was seen both in the covered and open form, often worn over a <A href="bword://gambeson">gambeson</A> , though it was sometimes worn under as well. There are illustrations that show the breastplate worn both over and under of an outer <A href="bword://houpelande">houpelande</A> , but by 1400 the usual practice was to attach the breastplate to the <A href="bword://backplate">backplate</A> and provide <A href="bword://Faulds">faulds</A> for the defense of the hip, the solution widely implemented during the whole of the 15th century. In the middle of the 14th century a &quotstop rib" was often added to the area just below the neck to keep <A href="bword://lance">lances</A> and <A href="bword://sword">sword</A> points from skipping up into the throat. During the same period, a lance rest was added to enable the knight to more easily couch the lance for a longer period of time. The edge around the neck and arm openings was rolled outward, sometimes over a wire, to guard against chafing and to help deflect a weapon from these vulnerable areas. <BR>15th century breastplates increased the size of the rolls around the neck and arm hole, and experiments were made with making the breastplate from multiple pieces to increase the knight's mobility while simultaneously increasing the protection.
Breviary	Book which contained the offices of religious figures at each of the <A href="bword://Canonical Hours">canonical hours</A> . Very popular with the <A href="bword://Nobility">nobility</A> , who were able to commission many fine books of hours for their own use.
Brigandine	Armour formed by the covering of small plates with cloth. Usually these were attached with <A href="bword://rivets">rivets</A> ; an excellent and popular defense for the body and upper legs during the 14th century, as evidenced by the massive find at Wisby, where thousands of bodies were buried in a peat bog in 1365. Brigandine coverings might be used for <A href="bword://body, defense of">body defenses</A> , <A href="bword://cuisses">cuisses</A> , <A href="bword://vambrace">vambraces</A> ; are easy to produce and to fit. Because of this, they were popular with the lesser nobility of Europe and the man-at-arms. Sometimes they were covered in <A href="bword://leather">leather</A> , and other times cloth was used. The cloth could be painted or a bright dye could be selected to give an individualistic edge to the decoration. Brigandines should be distinguished from the Jack popular in the 15th century, a coat of cloth or leather lined with many small plates.
Brittleness	The quality of metal that describes its likliness for the crystals to become detached, becoming a crack. Metal is said to be 'brittle' if it is likely to crack--this can be reduced by <A href="bword://anneal">annealing</A> the metal, allowing the crystals to realign. By their composition, some metals are more brittle than others: higher carbon steels are more brittle than lower carbon <A href="bword://steel">steels</A> , though they are also harder, and <A href="bword://brass">brass</A> is more brittle than <A href="bword://bronze">bronze</A> . Note that <A href="bword://hardness">hardness</A> and brittleness are distinct qualities, hardness referring to the metal's restistance to deforming and brittleness the tendency to crack.
Broadsword	The general two-edged blade popular from the 6th century onward. Ranging in length from 30" to 42" in length, the average <A href="bword://sword">sword</A> weighs only three to four pounds. Light enough to be used as a fighting tool all day, yet heavy enough to impart crushing impact along the edge, which was rarely sharpened. The weapons works by concentrating the force of the blow, the knight and the mass of the horse into the thin edge, often left to a thickness of between 1/16" - 1/8". The thickness at the center was between 3/16" and 1/4", and the blade generally started out from between 2-3" wide at the base and tapered gently to a point. See <A href="http://www.chronique.com/Chronique/chrniq13.htm">Chronique: The Journal of Chivalry #13</A> .
Bronze	Non-ferrous alloy of copper, tin and trace metals. Because of the copper base, bronze is very malleable and easy to work. Known interchangeably during the middle ages as <A href="bword://latten">latten</A> , it was used for adornment and decoration of armour during the 14th century. Early man first learned to work bronze more than 10,000 BC, discovering that the metal work-hardens quickly under the <A href="bword://Hammer (armourer's tool)">hammer</A> , making it a valuable metal for simple tools.
Bruiant	Charlemagne’s horse in the <A href="bword://Chansons de geste">chanson de geste</A> <I>Maugis d’Aigremont</I>, meaning ‘fiery.’
Bucephalus	The famous charger of Alexander the Great, the only person who could mount him, the horse which legend has it kneeled to allow his master to ride.
Buckler	Small round &quottarget" <A href="bword://shield (construction of)">shield</A> popular in Europe from the 13th to the 16th century. There is some doubt as to how often this shield was used outside of Scotland for war; there are many depictions of single combats using bucklers and <A href="bword://sword">sword</A> or dagger, although these may represent combats over points of honor, or what we might more commonly know as &quotduels." Shields in use during the 14th century are generally not round, but they are usually the pointed <A href="bword://heater">&quotheater"</A> shape we now associate with a <A href="bword://shield (knight's)">&quotmedieval knight's" shield</A> and <A href="bword://cote of arms">cote of arms</A> . <BR>The buckler may well have originated amongst the Norse people, who in their repeated &quotvisits" to England and the continent may have brought it with them and left it as a legacy in Scotland.
Buckles	The most popular form of attachment of armour to a limb or another piece of armour was by buckle and strap or by lacing them to the <A href="http://www.chronique.com/Library/Glossaries/glossary-AA/arms_a.htm#aketon">aketon</A> or hauberk. During the 14th century these buckles were often cast in bronze, and we are fortunate that many large deposits of such buckles have been unearthed in European cities during urban renewal projects. They seem to have been discarded with <A href="bword://leather">leather</A> rubbish and preserved and are a reasonable artifact that can be inexpensively purchased by the amateur medievalist. <BR>Straps on armour were often finished with bronze caps that protected the end of the buckle and eased the arming process by providing a firm base that could be easily grasped. The other end of the strap was generally attached to the outside of the armour with a wide-headed <A href="bword://rivets">rivet</A> <A href="http://www.chronique.com/Library/Glossaries/glossary-AA/arms_p.htm#pien">piened</A> over on the inside of the armour. Some straps were attached to the inside of the armour and secured with a rough washer on the inside and <a href="bword://pien">piened</A> on the outside, but this practice seems to have grown in popularity during the late 15th and early 16th century.
Bulbeggar	A coat designed for the disciplining of <A href="bword://Apprentice">apprentices</A> , a crude sack designed such that the unlucky apprentice could not see his attacker.
Burgess	Holder of a tenement, land or house, in a <A href="bword://Borough">borough</A> , an office carrying special judicial privileges and obligations to the borough. Burgesses grew in power during the 14th and 15th centuries, gradually building wealth based upon the commerce and production that took place in the borough.
Burgundians	Supports of Burgundy during their feud with the Orleanist faction that split France between 1388 and 1435.
Burres	(See <A href="bword://Grapers">Grapers</A> )
Bâton|Baton	A tourney sword from the 14th or 15th century. There are several contemporary illustrations that depict knights fighting on horseback with such &quotwands," although in one of the primary references, King René d'Anjou's Livre de Tournoi, the author uses the word <A href="bword://masse">&quotmasse"</A> . There is also contemporary evidence for these bâtons being made from <A href="bword://ash">ash</A> or <A href="bword://Whalebone, evidence for use as a tourney weapon">whalebone</A> . There are a couple of references alluding to the use of bâtons in the vespers challenges, competitions for squires and young knights bachelier held the night before a larger tournament.

The fort was allegedly revived during the 6th century, the time when the historical Arthur might have lived, and has come to be associated with the more well known name <A href="bword://Camelot">Camelot</A> , and has a host of interesting tales concerning it outside of the Arthurian association. Legends of Arthur have been popular here since at least the 15th century, when tales were told of hidden doors that opened into the hill twice per year, revealing Arthur's body. Since the 16th century, it has been said that on Midsummer's eve once every seven years, the ghosts of Arthur and his <A href="bword://Knight">knights</A> ride over the ruins.

A strip of steel or other metal was often fitted to the front of the helmet to protect the nose, called a &quotnasal." Common examples of these helmets can be seen in the Bayeaux Tapestry. They evolved from the Roman legionnaire's helmet and the crude spangen helmets that replaced them as Europe rebuilt following the fall of Rome. During the early years of the 14th century most casques were replaced with <A href="bword://bascinet">bascinets</A> as more defense was sought against arrows and the <A href="bword://Neck, defense of">defense of the neck</A> and <A href="bword://head, defense of">head</A> were enhanced.
Castellan	Governor or <A href="bword://Constable">constable</A> of a <A href="bword://Castle">castle</A> , generally in the <A href="bword://Lord">lord's</A> absence.
Castle	A defensive residence of a <A href="bword://Lord">lord</A> , distinguished from other fortifications in the dual role as residence and fort. Because castles were symbols of lordship over a region, they were the frequent targets in warfare, since they were easily defended by a relatively few men, tying down a much larger force often for months at a time. Early castles, the 'motte' or '<A href="bword://Bailey">bailey</A> ' styles, were build generally on a hill, a '<A href="bword://Keep">keep</A> ' designed to enhance the tactical value of the hill. Over the centuries, these simple defenses were augmented with various ingenious architectural enhancements that improved both their defensive capabilities and their aesthetic qualities.

Cavalry	A mounted man, a '<A href="bword://Chevalier">chevalier</A> ', a horseman. The chevalier is the root of the word '<A href="bword://Chivalry">chivalry</A> '. During the Middle Ages it was a commonly belief military theorem that no force on the battlefield could stand up to a charge by heavy cavalry. This belief was reinforced by various defeats of <A href="bword://Infantry">infantry</A> by cavalry, such as at <A href="bword://Hastings, Battle of">Hastings</A> . During the 14th century a more balanced approach to warfare was experimented with by the Scots and English, especially by Edward III and Robert the Bruce. Edward made excellent use of <A href="bword://Artillery">artillery</A> in the form of <A href="bword://Archer">archers</A> , infantry in the form of dismounted <A href="bword://Knight">knights</A> supported by a flanking unit of cavalry.

By the 1330s the helmet had evolved completely into the <A href="bword://Bascinet">bascinet</A> , displacing the great helmet completely except for use in some jousts.
Chain (of fealty)|Chain|Chain of fealty|Chains	The chains worn by <A href="bword://Knight">knights</A> within the <A href="bword://scaaa">SCA</A> to mark their <A href="bword://Fealty">fealty</A> to the <A href="bword://Crown">Crown</A> . In medieval England, there is some evidence that great officers and knights wore such chains as tokens of their loyalty.
Challenge	Calling another combatant out to combat, a challenge can be <A href="bword://À plaisir">à plaisance</A> , friendly, or à la guerre, as in war. The challenge was a frequent device for <A href="bword://Knight">knights</A> who would call out opponents known to them in war, <A href="bword://Tournament (Tournoi)">tournament</A> , or to settle questions of <A href="bword://Honor">honor</A> . During the 15th century, the challenge became a common feature of the <A href="bword://Feat of Arms">feat of arms</A> , both of the <A href="bword://Emprise">emprise</A> , where such encounters were held with weapons of war, and similar encounters using arms of peace called the <A href="bword://Pas d’Armes">pas d'armes</A> .
Chamberlain	The office, from the 10th century, the denoted the <A href="bword://King">king's</A> servant responsible for keeping the kings chamber and his signet, growing through the centuries to account for matters of domestic affairs and etiquette of the palace.
Chamfron	The plate defense guarding the horse's face. 14th century examples seem to be very rare, with little refinement, using globular pierced defenses for the eyes. The chamfron became well developed in the 15th century, when the horse was more fully armoured in plate. The <A href="bword://Crinet">Crinet</A> , another portion of horse <A href="bword://barding">barding</A> , defended the horse's neck.
Champion for Ordeals	In <A href="bword://Trial by Battle or Combat">trials by combat</A> or <A href="bword://Judicial Duel">judicial duels</A> , frequently held in England and on the continent prior to the 14th century, these champions were professional fighters hired on the sly to champion a tenant unable to defend himself. Technically such championing was illegal, but difficult to prove. The deterrence came from the Continental penalty that the losing champion lost his hand, since in order to take to the <A href="bword://List">lists</A> they had to swear to the charge, and in losing they were forsworn.
Chancellor of England	Originally a clerk and chaplain, the chancellor gradually evolved into one of the most powerful offices in England, keeper of the <A href="bword://King">king's</A> secretariat. The chancellor, well schooled, was to keep the king's seal and authenticate important state documents. The chancellor was the 'king's conscience' and the appeal of last resort in legal cases not covered by common or statute law. <BR>- <A href="http://www.chronique.com/Library/Knights/coronation.htm#Chancellor">Coronation Ceremony Reference</A> (14th - 15th C.)
Chancery	From the late 10th century, the English office responsible for writing the <A href="bword://King">king's</A> charters, writs and letters. In the late 12th century, under Hubert Walter, archbishop of Canterbury and <A href="bword://Chancellor of England">Chancellor of England</A> , the office began recording letters in long rolls; these rolls have proven a valuable historical record for the study of English history. The chancery issued three main types of documents-charters (making permanent grants of land or privileges); letters patent (making temporary privedges); and letters close (bearing secret instructions for royal officials).
Chanson d'Antioche	The work is a 'history' of the first <A href="bword://Crusade">crusade</A> surrounding the career of Godfrey de Bouillon, begun c. 1180 and added to during the 13th and 14th centuries.
Chanson d'Aspremont	Epic from the last decade of the 12th century, the poem details an incident at Charlemagne's <A href="bword://Court">court</A> where a messenger from <A href="bword://King">king</A> Agolant so infuriates Charlemagne that he sets out with his army and a young, untried <A href="bword://Knight">knight</A> named Roland. The work details Roland's early career, how he won his mystical sword <A href="bword://Durendal">Durendal</A> and his horse.
Chanson de Roland	See the <A href="bword://Song of Roland">Song of Roland</A> .
Chansons de geste	Old French epic poetry, averaging about 3900 lines, in ten-syllable verse. They glorified the Franks, the Christian religion, and a few of the famous Carolingian <A href="bword://Knight">knights</A> . Thought much of the subject matter was legendary, they were extraordinarily popular; many believed them to be historical. They remained powerful testaments to the ingenuity and sincerity.
Chantry	Endowment in a will for priests to sing masses to <A href="bword://Honor">honor</A> the deceased-the word was also applied to the priests who were thus employed.
Chapel de Fer	Literally <A href="bword://iron">iron</A> cap. This was generally a domed helmet, made in three or more pieces, with a wide brow around the outside. During the 14th century it was widely used by English and French men-at-arms and bachelier knights who could not afford a <A href="bword://bascinet">bascinet</A> . Squires and other retainers probably also wore them, and they were often the helmet of choice amongst archers, since if an archer were to lower his head when a salvo of arrows was expected, the whole face would be momentarily covered.
Charge	A tactical maneuver where a unit moves forward at great speed, using speed and mass to attempt to break up an opponent's forces or movement. The charge was the favored maneuver of the medieval <A href="bword://Knight">knight</A> , who used the mass of his horse, <A href="bword://Armour (Armor)">armour</A> and heavy <A href="bword://Lance (weapon used in the joust)">lance</A> , combined with close-order movement by other knights, to focus a crushing movement. Few could stand against such a charge, but the tactic was worn by improvements in missile technology, new tactics for <A href="bword://Pike">pikes</A> and <A href="bword://Spear">spears</A> , and the selection of more defensive positions where <A href="bword://Cavalry">cavalry</A> are less effective, such as in marshes, rough ground or in fortifications. As a tactic the charge hinges on the seizure of initiative, where both surprise and mass are used to place an enemy off balance.
Charge, heraldic|heraldic Charge	The main element on a knight's device or arms, such as a dragon, lion, star, etc. <BR>
Charlemagne (Charles the Great, 724-814)|Charlemagne|Charles the Great	Perhaps the greatest medieval king, one of the <A href="bword://Nine Worthies">Nine Worthies</A> .

Charlemagne's Tree of Shields|Tree of Shields	A device used in a <a href="bword://Pas d’Armes">pas d'armes</A> from which the <a href="bword://Shield (construction of)">shields</A> are hung. A challenger, the <a href="bword://Venans">venan</A> , selects the style of combat he wants by rapping the shield of his choice. The use of such trees dates to the 14th century.
Charles Martel	()
Chastity	The idea of chastity as a <A href="bword://Chivalry">chivalric</A> virtue was added chiefly by the religious <A href="bword://Orders of knighthood">orders of knighthood</A> , the <A href="bword://Templar, Knights (Knights of the Temple)">Templars</A> and <A href="bword://Hospitallers">Hospitallers</A> , who took a vow of chastity as a part of their monastic role. Chastity per se was not a part of secular chivalry, rather it was taken to be that knights should refrain from yielding to certain sinful draws of the flesh-i.e. Lusting after another man's wife. In the realm of <A href="bword://Courtly Love">courtly love</A> , marriage was not necessarily a requirement for love. Ramon Lull counseled knights to forgo the sins of lust, but said nothing about complete abstention.
Chausses	<A href="bword://Mail">Mail</A> defenses for the thigh.
Cheapside Tournament	{}
Cheques	Books of account where the results of <A href="bword://Joust">jousts</A> were kept, generally from the late 15th century onwards. Often these books were accompanied by color depictions of the <A href="bword://Knight">knight's</A> <A href="bword://Device (heraldic)">devices</A> , making them a colorful record of late <A href="bword://Tournament (Tournoi)">tournaments</A> .
Chevalier	French for <A href="bword://Knight">knight</A> -literally 'horseman'.
Chevauchée|Chevauchee	A burn and slash kind of war where the enemy army was lured to the field to protect the economic vitality of a region. It was used with great effect by the English under Edward III and the Black Prince during the <A href="bword://Hundred Years War">Hundred Years War</A> .
Chevauchée|Chevauchee	A common war-tactic of the 14th century, a sort of slash-and-burn attack centering on the economic production of a region, designed to force the opponent to engage. The English used such tactics during the <a href="bword://Hundred Years War">Hundred Years War</A> against France and Spain, often with devastating effects on the citizenry, but with questionable strategic gains.

As such, their accounts are often not completely factual, but are highly descriptive and probably representative of the perceptions of the knights of the day, or at the very least are sympathetic to their points view.
Chivalric combat	See <A href="bword://Judicial Duel">Judicial Duel</A> .
Chivalry	The collection of virtues belonging to a <A href="bword://Knight">knight</A> or the description of a virtuous action expected of a knight. Because it describes a set of virtues that changed over the whole medieval period, the meaning of the word evolved and changed over time, eventually merging with the concept of the <A href="bword://Gentleman">gentleman</A> . Modern <A href="bword://Tournament Society">tournament societies</A> strive to embody chivalric character in their memberships, attempting to create different levels of authenticity and ethical standards. See also <A href="bword://Book of the Tournament">The Book of the Tournament</A> .
Chivalry, the	Another term for a group of <a href="bword://Knight">knights</A> , as in &quotdiscuss it with the chivalry." It was a general term stemming from the French term for knights, <a href="bword://Chevalier">chevalier</A> . It became, during the 12th - 15th centuries, a term used also to describe the virtues and ideals associated with the knight as well, generalized by the use of the word in a broad sense. &quotAn act of <a href="bword://Chivalry">chivalry</A> ." <BR>
Chronicles of Engeurrand de Monstrelet (Monstrelet's Chroniques)|Chronicles of Engeurrand de Monstrelet|Monstrelet's Chroniques	Similar in many respects to <A href="bword://Chronicles of Froissart (Froissart's Chroniques)">Froissart's chronicles</A> , Monstrelet's work, clearly in the same tradition and bearing the same pitfalls, he chronicles the struggle between the <A href="bword://Duke">Dukes</A> of Orleans and the Dukes of Burgundy from 1400 - 1485, in the process becoming a valuable recorder of <A href="bword://Pas d'Armes">pas d'armes</A> and <A href="bword://Emprise">emprises</A> in France during the 15th century. Monstrelet is generally hard to find, the only English translation I have found being produced by EETS.
Chronicles of Froissart (Froissart's Chroniques)|Chronicles of Froissart|Froissart's Chroniques	The historical memoirs of Froissart detailing the diplomatic, military and <A href="bword://Chivalry, the">chivalric</A> affairs of England, France and Spain during the <A href="bword://Hundred Years War">Hundred Years War</A> , chiefly from 1320 - 1400. Froissart was widely traveled, but the Chroniques are of dubious historical value, though since Froissart himself was popular at the English court, it can be expected that they reflect the perceptions of the chivalric classes. Written in French, the Chroniques have been reprinted many times and are easily available to students of medieval culture. The most available edition is by Penguin Books, while the most complete editions were released in the 19th century by Kervyn de Lettenhove, huge volumes containing more than 4,000 pages of very small print.

Church and Knights|Church	The influence of the church over the <A href="bword://Knight">knights</A> and the conception of <A href="bword://Chivalry">chivalry</A> is far more complicated than can be covered in a simple definition. Originally rough warriors, the <A href="bword://Milites">milites</A> were viewed as a danger to the local populace, who they frequently overran in their petty disputes and <A href="bword://Tournament (Tournoi)">tourneys</A> . The church preferred that the soldier's energy be put to holy use-soldiers of Christ defending the church with the sword even as the clergy defended the church with their minds and books. Although the church did affect the conception of ethical behavior for knights, adding the virtues of humility, defense of the weak and of women, piety, faith and <A href="bword://Chastity">chastity</A> to the chivalric ethic. By preaching the <A href="bword://Crusade">Crusades</A> at the <A href="bword://Council of Claremont">Council of Claremont</A> , the church did succeed in firing up the chivalry, many of whom were unemployed, with an energy and a common enemy, thus diverting their attention from factional disputes within Europe. Out of the Crusades came contact with the Eastern ways of life and organizations of religious knights organizing themselves along the lines of a sort of military monastaries, the <A href="bword://Templar, Knights (Knights of the Temple)">Templars</A> and <A href="bword://Hospitallers">Hospitallers</A> .

Generally these courts were held under the auspices of a <A href="http://www.chronique.com/Library/Glossaries/glossary-KCT/gloss_b.htm#bishop">bishop</A> or archdeacon, sometimes under an archbishop or pope. Anyone who could prove the 'benefit of the clergy' came under their jurisdiction.

Cinq Ports	{}
Claymore	The large two-handed <A href="bword://sword">swords</A> popular in Scotland during the 15th, 16th and even the 17th centuries. Ranging in length from 50" to 72", they possessed handles that were 18" - 21" in length. Overall the swords weighed only six or seven pounds, although there are examples that are as much as ten pounds. These swords were popular also in Germany and in the Swiss states during the 15th and 16th centuries, although the term Claymore seems to have been restricted to Scotland. The term two-handed sword or greatsword seems more popular on the continent.
Cligés|Cliges	An Alexandrian <A href="bword://Romances">romance</A> by Chrètien de Troyes, in which many allusions to the <A href="bword://Tristan & Iseult">Tristan &amp; Iseult</A> tales are included, in which the hero's son pursues a woman not yet free to love, so she takes a potion that makes her appear dead so that they can be free to love.
Close Helmet	The first 'international' style of helmet, evolved from the <A href="bword://armet">armet</A> during the 16th century.

Collar of S	Collars consisting of many &quots" letters linked together, worn by various great officers in England. It was apparently worn as a sign of <A href="bword://Nobility">nobility</A> , but the origin in unclear. Some have put forward that the &quots" is for 'sovereign'. The collar of 's' was granted by Henry IV as a sign of nobility, as well as being the household badge for the house of Lancaster. There is some evidence that these chains were in use before this, however, so their origin remains obscure.

Combat of the Thirty	1351. At Ploermel in Brittany, thirty French <A href="bword://Knight">knights</A> met the same number of English, with no restrictions to weapons, resulting in nine English and six French casualties. Several more died later of wounds received. All of this fighting took place on foot, there were mercenaries around, but the <A href="bword://Renown">renown</A> attached to the combatants in both kingdoms followed them for years to come, money and offices following the <A href="bword://Glory">glory</A> earned in combat. This is perhaps the most famous example of an emprise, fought as a challenge with weapons à la guerre, as opposed to a <A href="bword://Pas d’Armes">pas d'armes</A> , where such a combat would be fought <A href="bword://À plaisir">à plaisance</A> , for pleasure.

The Company of Saint Michael requires SCA <A href="bword://Knighthood">knighthood</A> for membership, but maintains a <A href="bword://Cadet">cadet</A> household to include non-knights in St. Michael activities. Saint Michael has been most active at Pennsic War, where they were the first to bring the <A href="bword://Pas d'Armes">pas d'armes</A> to Pennsic. They have done much work with Galleron in the East kingdom working around the <A href="bword://René-style Tournament">King René theme</A> , striving to bring greater authenticity to the tournament experience.

Their authority extended to all affairs relating to relations between soldiers and merchants, and in relations between soldiers. During the 16th century, the two presided over <A href="bword://Court of Chivalry">courts of chivalry</A> .
Constantinople	Founded in 330 by the Emperor Constantine, it was built on the site of a Greek town called Byzantium, and this gave its name to Constantine's empire, which was to weather the fall of Rome intact until the late 15th century.
Coquillards	Large groups of bandits roaming the French countryside during the 1450s. They were largely rounded up in Burgundy from 1455-57, but their striking language was immortalized by the poet François Villard.
Coronal	The head of a <A href="bword://lance">lance</A> , fitted for the joust of peace instead of the sharp point used for war. Using multiple points (generally but not always limited to three) it spread the impact and reduced the damage.
Coronation	The ceremony marking the <A href="bword://Crown">crowning</A> of a new monarch or <A href="bword://King">king</A> . These ceremonies became very involved, centering around the <A href="bword://Anoint">annointing</A> , where the king ceases to become mortal and takes on a divine character. <BR><BR><A href="http://www.chronique.com/Library/Knights/coronacion.htm">Middle English Coronation ceremony</A> (1365-1480)<BR><A href="http://www.chronique.com/Library/Knights/coronation.htm">Modern English Copy of above</A> (1365-1480)
Coronet	The circlets worn by the members of the Royal family other than the <A href="bword://King">king</A> , and by members of the <A href="bword://Nobility">nobility</A> , especially after the middle of the 15th century. <BR>Within the <A href="bword://Society for Creative Anachronism (SCA)">SCA</A> , coronets have a particular meaning. <A href="bword://Duke">Dukes</A> can wear coronets that feature strawberry leaves. <A href="bword://Count">Counts</A> , <A href="bword://Earl">earls</A> and the equivalents, each of whom has emerged victorious from <A href="bword://Crown Tournament">Crown Tournament</A> one time, have embattled coronets. <A href="bword://Viscount">Viscounts</A> , who have attained the victory in a <A href="bword://Coronet List">Coronet list</A> , are entitled to a pointed coronet. <A href="bword://Court Baron">Court barons</A> have coronets with pearls. The standards for coronets vary from <A href="bword://Kingdom, SCA">kingdom</A> to kingdom in the SCA, as they did in Europe for the period.

Cote Armour, jupon|Cote Armou|jupon	A quilted garment worn over a <A href="bword://breastplate">breastplate</A> or <A href="bword://Cote of Plates, Pair of Plates, Plates">cote of plates</A> or as the sole <A href="bword://body, defense of">body defense</A> during the 14th century. Such armours were popular in England since they required little technical skill to manufacture, were light and easy to transport. Popular amongst men-at-arms and archers-they were often worn with the <A href="bword://chapel de fer">chapel de fer</A> for the <A href="bword://head, defense of">defense of the head</A> .
Cote of Arms	A word that seems to have been interchangeable meaning a <A href="bword://Cote Armour, jupon">cote armour</A> blazoned with a device or a <A href="bword://surcoat">surcoat</A> bearing the heraldic charge of a man's affiliation. Because it was the most visible expression of a knight's arms, the word has come to mean the heraldic device itself rather than the cote upon which it was sewn, painted, or embroidered.
Cote of Plates, Pair of Plates, Plates|Pair of Plates|Plates	A cloth or <A href="bword://leather">leather</A> covered armour for the body with several large plates <A href="bword://rivets">riveted</A> underneath for the <A href="bword://body, defense of">defense of the body</A> . The most famous examples were unearthed at the Battle of Wisby site, dating from the mid-14th century. For the first half of the century they were made of flat plates, but gradually the <A href="bword://breastplate">breastplate</A> was <A href="bword://dishing">dished</A> to conform to the shape of the body and the waist was drawn in for the characteristic &quotwasp-waisted" element of <A href="bword://transitional period">transitional style</A> .
Couch	A technique where the <A href="bword://Lance (weapon used in the joust)">lance</A> is held under the arm to steady it during a course, substantially reducing the amount of flex and increasing the accuracy of a lunge.
Council of Claremont	A meeting of the ninth <A href="bword://Canon">canon</A> in 1130 whereby the church attempted to cause the cessation of <A href="bword://Tournament (Tournoi)">tournaments</A> , repeated again in 1139 and in 1179. See also the <A href="bword://Peace of God">Peace and Truce of God</A> .<BR><I>&quotWe firmly prohibit those detestable markets or faires at which knights are accustomed to meet to show off their strength and their boldness and at which the deaths of men and dangers to the soul often occur. But if anyone is killed there, even if he demands and is not denied penance and the viaticum, ecclesiastical burial shall be withheld from him."</I> --Histoire des Conciles, Paris, 1912
Count	Administrative in Merovingian and Carolingian France, inheritors of what became, during the middle ages, as the Counties. The title of count merged with the Anglo-Saxon conception of <A href="bword://Earl">Earl</A> , a title carrying more governing and military responsibilities. The two together merged, becoming synonymous, Earl being correct in England and Count or Compte in France. Graf was the German equivalent, Jarl the Welsh. Counts rank above <A href="bword://Baron">barons</A> and <A href="bword://Viscount">viscounts</A> , but below <A href="bword://Duke">dukes</A> , and are known by the title 'excellency'. <BR>Within the <A href="bword://Society for Creative Anachronism (SCA)">SCA</A> , the rank of Count or Earl is applied to gentles who have reigned once, proving victorious in <A href="bword://Crown Tournament">Crown Tournament</A> and thus reigning over an SCA <A href="bword://Kingdom, SCA">kingdom</A> for four to seven months.
Count of Flanders technique	A soured technique, known during both the 13th and 14th centuries, whereby a group of <A href="bword://Knight">knights</A> would hold themselves out of the action until late in the <A href="bword://Mêlée">mêlée</A> , when they would descend upon the now-tired tourneyers and scoop up easy pickings for the <A href="bword://Ransom">ransoms</A> and equipment.
Counted Blows	There are many period references to combats of x number of courses, where the combat might have entailed a number of blows received, or perhaps of a number thrown. <BR>In the modern tournament companies, both traditions have prospered. In the '<A href="bword://Company of Saint George">Saint George</A> ' method, the number of blows thrown is regulated. The fighting tends to be more poised and precise, but some say less intense. It gives an advantage to combatants who are precise in their blows. In the '<A href="bword://Company of Saint Michael">Saint Michael</A> ' method, the number of blows received is counted, yielding a different kind of fight-one with more blows thrown, generally with less precision, but with more action. It tends to favor those who throw many blows. See <A href="http://www.chronique.com/Chronique/chrniq04.htm">Chronique: The Journal of Chivalry #4</A> .
County	Divisions of land in France formed in the 9th century and in England after the conquest in 1066. The feudal <A href="bword://Lord">lord</A> of a county, the English <A href="bword://Count">Count</A> or French Compte, were powerful <A href="bword://Nobility">nobles</A> who ranked below a <A href="bword://Duke">Duke</A> and above <A href="bword://Viscount">viscounts</A> and <A href="bword://Baron">barons</A> .
Coup de Grace	The death-blow a <A href="bword://Knight">knight</A> gave to his mortally wounded opponent, often using the misiacorde.
Courage	One of the original warrior virtues, one that is shared by all warrior cultures, along with loyalty and <A href="bword://Prowess">prowess</A> . To be courageous, it has been said, is doing the right thing regardless of cost; it is a condition of a strong soul rather than of a strong body. Ramon Lull had a few words on the subject:<BR><I>&quotIf </I><A href="bword://Chivalry">chivalry</A> <I> were stronger of body than is strength of courage, the order of chivalry would be more in accord with the body than with the soul. If it were such then the body would be more noble than the soul, and that is openly false. So nobility of courage may not be vanquished of men, nor surmounted, nor all of these men who have been what she is in her right strength. And when a body is lightly taken and vanquished of another, it is obvious that the courage of man is more strong and noble than the body. A </I><A href="bword://Knight">knight</A> <I> who accompanies his </I><A href="bword://Lord">lord</A> <I> into battle, who for lack of courage flees the battle when he should give aid, because he more redoubts or fears the torment or peril more than of his courage uses not the office of chivalry. Neither is he the servant nor obedient to other honors, but is against the honor of chivalry, which was bygone by nobility and courage. If the lesser nobility of courage should accord better to the order of chivalry than to the greater one of the soul, unto chivalry should accord sloth of heart and cowardice against hardiness and strength of courage. And if it were thus, sloth and courage should be the office of a knight, and hardness and strength of courage should disordain the order of chivalry." </I>
Course	In a joust, to run a single pass with <A href="bword://Lance (weapon used in the joust)">lances</A> or <A href="bword://Sword">swords</A> was a course. Barber and Barker suggest in their <A href="bword://Tournament (Tournoi)">tournaments</A> book that a course might also have been a 'bout'; a single fight determined in a variety of manners-counted blows struck or received; until an opponent was knocked to their knees; or perhaps until a particularly fine blow was struck. See also <A href="bword://Counted Blows">counted blows</A> .
Courser	The best examples of a <A href="bword://Knight">knight's</A> warhorse, the crème de la crème, often valued from &pound20 to &pound100, prices something like that of a modern Mercedes or Cadillac. The more common warhorses were like modern hunters, known then as <A href="bword://Destrier, Dextrarius">destriers</A> .
Court	The administrative, judicial, and political body of authority for a <A href="bword://Feudalism">feudal</A> body. Adopted from the Roman conception of the curia, the concept was modified by the Germanic tribes, who attached both military and political elements to the leader's responsibilities. This is, in part, how feudal lords came to have such great powers over their <A href="bword://Vassal">vassals</A> . Gradually, the concept of the court came to encompass not only the <A href="bword://Nobility">noble</A> in charge of a body, but the chief officers and vassals who served him, since they would in many cases play some role in the dispensing of justice. The four principal officers of the court, the <A href="bword://Constable">constable</A> (military officer), <A href="bword://Chamberlain">chamberlain</A> (treasurer), <A href="bword://Seneschal">seneschal</A> (administrator of justice in the absence of the lord), and <A href="bword://Steward">steward</A> (who administered to the estates).
Court Baron	A <A href="bword://Court">court</A> of free tenants who determined the fate of other free tenants prior to the 14th century. Also a handbook by the same name, for use by seigniorial <A href="bword://Lord">lords</A> , containing precedence and guides so that justice might be more evenly administered. <BR>Within the <A href="bword://Society for Creative Anachronism (SCA)">SCA</A> , a court baron is one who is recognized by the <A href="bword://Crown">Crown</A> for service, it carries with it a patent of arms and admits the honored gentle into the ranks of the <A href="bword://Nobility">nobility</A> without carrying a peerage of <A href="bword://Knight">knight</A> , <A href="bword://Laurel, Order of the">laurel</A> or <A href="bword://Pelican, Order of the">pelican</A> .
Court of Chivalry	Strictly speaking, a <A href="bword://Court">court</A> of military affairs concerned with the conduct of soldiers under the <A href="bword://Constable">constable</A> and&nbspmarshal, the two principle military officers in England or France, or by their representatives. Although the term 'court of chivalry' did not exist formally prior to the 1389, when the <A href="bword://Parliament (English)">English parliament</A> declared the purview of the court to be,<BR><I>'Cognizance of contracts touching deeds of war out of the realm, and also to things that touch arms of war within the realm, which cannot be determined nor discussed by common law, with other usages or customs to the same matters pertaining, which other constables heretofore have duly and reasonably used in their time.'</I><BR>So this declaration of 1389 merely formalized a process which was already been in place. During the 15th century, when the feudal terms of service had been replaced by a knight's tenure of service, such courts heard disputes in the contracts of such service, the cases argued by lawyers rather than the knights themselves. <BR>Criminally, the court could hear cases of treason and murder, and it is in cases where there is no direct evidence, where it is the word of one against the other, that trial by combat could be used. Such trials were complicated affairs, growing from such cases to also include disputes over heraldic rights and over matters of honor.
Courtain	The shorter <A href="bword://Sword">sword</A> of Ogier the Dane, mentioned in the <A href="bword://Chansons de geste">chanson de geste</A> of the same name. His other weapon was <A href="bword://Sauvaign">Sauvaign</A> .
Courtesy	Not one of the original <A href="bword://Chivalry">chivalric</A> virtues, the idea that a <A href="bword://Knight">knight</A> should be courteous came from the influence of the <A href="bword://Court">court</A> , the ladies, and the <A href="bword://Romances">romances</A> . A knight was expected to be courteous to men of all stations, although the concept of what was 'courteous' changed over time. What was considered 'courteous' in the days of William the Marshal would be considered barbaric to the <A href="bword://Duke">Dukes</A> of Burgundy in the 15th century. The addition of courtesy to the marshal suite of virtues is one of the things that distinguishes chivalry from other warrior codes, for example from Bushido, the Japanese warrior code.
Courtesy title	The courtesy title, one step below that of the actual rank of an heir. For example, a <A href="bword://Duke">duke's</A> first son could style himself '<A href="bword://Earl">earl</A> ', unless the family actually possessed other titles, in which case he would 'use' the lesser titles as his own.
Courtly Love	A term first used by Gaston Paris in 1883 article to describe the 'culture' of love and system of love and adoration developed in Northern France during the late 12th century. Under this system, the lover, who pursued his illicit and passionate love relentlessly, was ennobled by the experience. Some writers claimed that the search itself was enough to improve the character of the lover, while others maintained that he would be a fool to pursue such a venture without recompense, be it a smile or a look or perhaps more intimate conclusion. In general courtly love took place outside the boundaries of marriage, which is one of the reasons that the medieval church took such strong objections to it. <BR>Andreas Cappallanus, Chrètien de Troyes and Marie de Champagne are three names inextricably twined with the movement, but the effect of the movement was to draw the attention of the <A href="bword://Knight">knights</A> away from the battlefield and <A href="bword://Crusade">crusade</A> or religious duties and add conceptions of <A href="bword://Courtesy">courtesy</A> , <A href="bword://Largesse">generosity</A> , defense and respect for women to the extant religious and military virtues. In this manner the courtly love movement strongly impacted with accepted way that women were treated and defended in our own culture even to the present day.
Courtoisie	Fr. for <A href="bword://Courtesy">courtesy</A> .
Courtrai, Battle of|Battle of Courtrai|Courtrai	July, 1302. The French <A href="bword://Chivalry, the">chivalry</A> under the <A href="bword://Count">Count</A> of Flanders engaged a large force of lowland footsoldiers armed with a kind of halberd called a godendang, having prepared their defensive position in advance by digging pits in front of the expected French charge. The French sent their own footsoldiers ahead, but soon grew impatient as the battle proved indecisive, riding down their own men only to be themselves cut down in the confusion.
Couter	The defense for the elbow, generally mistakenly called the &quotelbow cop" in modern SCA parlance. During the 14th century these were generally reasonably shallow, starting off rounded in the early part of the century and progressing towards a more conical but still rounded shape as the century progressed. In the second quarter of the century a <A href="bword://wing">&quotwing"</A> was added to the couter to improve the protection for the joint itself, first affixed with laces, then with <A href="bword://rivets">rivets</A> , and finally, mid-century, was made integral to the couter itself. Wing decoration then flourished, with the shapes varying by region, date and fashion du jour. About the same time that the more conical shape came into popularity, possibly because of this need, the couter was during the second half of the century now <A href="bword://articulation">articulated</A> using two or three <A href="bword://lames">lames</A> to attach it into a single jointed defense from the wrist (defended by the <A href="bword://vambrace">vambrace</A> ) and the upper arm (defended by the <A href="bword://rerebrace">rerebrace</A> ). See <A href="bword://Arm Harness">Arm Harness</A> for a more detailed description of the development.
Craven	The word applied to the losing champion in a <A href="bword://Trial by Battle or Combat">trial by combat</A> or <A href="bword://Judicial Duel">judicial duel</A> , since the loss of the duel proved him to be perjured. As an 'infamous' person, he lost is right to law and could never again appear as a witness. On the continent sometimes such a loss carried with it the severe penalty of losing a hand, since the perjury was knowingly issued under <A href="bword://Oath">oath</A> .
Crenellations	The embattled upper portion of a medieval <A href="bword://Castle">castle</A> wall, designed to protect the defenders.
Crinet	The armour for a horses neck, not popular until the 15th century. It was made with overlapping plates from the top to the bottom, held together either with <A href="bword://leather">leather</A> strips or by sliding <A href="bword://rivets">rivets</A> (the latter was much more common during the 16th century, when sliding rivets became universally accepted). Made of very thin <A href="bword://steel">steel</A> , perhaps 22 gage, the plates were often <A href="bword://fluting">fluted</A> or <A href="bword://flaring">flared</A> for strength.
Crockard	A forged English <A href="bword://Penny">penny</A> of reduced weight created in the Low Countries in the very last years of the 13th century. They were 'minted' in large numbers, undermining the English economy and causing Edward I to ban them in 1299.

Crown	The diadem or circlet worn by the <A href="bword://King">king</A> or monarch to signify their status, the Crown came to be imbued with a great deal of symbolic power, though the object itself was apparently worn seldom, mostly in <A href="bword://Court">court</A> or for state occasions. Various monarchs during the high middle ages were from time to time forced to pawn their crowns to raise money, some of which were never recovered. Edward III's crown suffered such a fate as he was forced to borrow extensively to support his campaigns in France. <BR>The term can also be used to refer to the person of the king, with an allusion to their power-'the crown'. Within the <A href="bword://Society for Creative Anachronism (SCA)">SCA</A> , the term 'crown' does indeed refer to the person and to the office of the king, both.
Crown Prince	Their heir to the throne, ranking in precedence above all other <A href="bword://Prince">princes</A> in a kingdom. In England, the Prince of Wales was the Crown Prince for most of the high middle ages. This usage continues today both in reference to the Royal house of Britain and within the <A href="bword://Society for Creative Anachronism (SCA)">SCA</A> , where it applies to the victor of <A href="bword://Crown Tournament" tournament?>Crown Tournament</A> , the 'heir apparent', who will step up and be crowned king during the '<A href="bword://Coronation">coronation</A> ' ceremony.
Crown Tournament	Within the <A href="bword://Society for Creative Anachronism (SCA)">SCA</A> , the <A href="bword://Tournament (Tournoi)">tournaments</A> held two or three times per year in each <A href="bword://Kingdom, SCA">kingdom</A> to determine who will reign for the next period. Such tournaments are generally, but not always, <A href="bword://Double-elimination lists">double-elimination lists</A> , where each combatant may lose two combats before being eliminated. Generally conducted with a great deal of ceremony, because there is a prize accorded to the victor, the right to reign, these lists are the greatest tests of virtue in the spectrum of SCA tourneys, they are either affairs where great <A href="bword://Honor">honor</A> and <A href="bword://Renown">renown</A> are won or lost.

The object of the crusades was at first to release the <A href="http://www.chronique.com/Library/Glossaries/glossary-KCT/gloss_h.htm#Holy Land">Holy Land</A> , in particular Jerusalem, from the Saracens, but in time was extended to seizing Spain from the Moors, the Slavs and Pagans from eastern Europe, and the islands of the Mediterranean. The first crusade, which lasted from 1095-1099, established the latin <A href="bword://Kingdom of Jerusalem">Kingdom of Jerusalem</A> , providing more lands for the crusading <A href="bword://Knight">knights</A> , who often traveled across Europe to try their fortunes and to visit the Holy Sepulcher. The kingdom was gradually lost until the last Christian city, <A href="bword://Acre">Acre</A> , fell in 1291. The dream of returning to the Holy Land nonetheless proved popular; the <A href="bword://King">Kings</A> of France and England frequently made such plans, though in nearly every case the crusades were redirected or derailed by regional tensions. <BR>The crusades also gave rise to the important <A href="bword://Orders of knighthood">knightly orders</A> , the <A href="bword://Templar, Knights (Knights of the Temple)">Templars</A> and the <A href="bword://Hospitallers">Hospitallers</A> , orders of religious knights, working from monastic rule to defend the holy land and pilgrims en route to the same lands.

During the 14th century, the breastplate was often made from a single piece of steel and the backplate from a <A href="bword://brigandine">brigandine</A> , but during the 15th the breastplate was generally made in two or more pieces (especially in the German <A href="bword://gothic armour">&quotgothic"</A> examples) and the back in many pieces. The piecing yielded a good deal of increased mobility and made the <A href="bword://harness">harnesses</A> much easier to produce. <BR>Italian cuirasses were often more rounded in shape, keeping with the <A href="bword://Milanese">Milanese</A> school lines, formed of larger pieces of thicker steel. German models were sharper, formed of more numerous and thinner plates, often featuring <A href="bword://fluting">fluting</A> to increase the strength lost with the use of small, thin plates.
Cuirboille|courboille	A material used for armour to add rigidity. It was made, by all accounts, by boiling or painting a heavy <A href="bword://leather">leather</A> with beeswax, probably enhanced with other ingredients. I believe that there was a good deal more cuirboille around than has been recorded, in part because it would be very cheap for a medieval economy to produce and in part because it stands up very well to repeated blows. I believe that it might well have been far more common for squires and practicing men-at-arms or knights to wear cuirboille when practicing, then put on a metal <A href="bword://harness">harness</A> à la guerre for war.

These defenses were often elaborately carved and studded, and probably <A href="bword://painting (armour)">painted</A> as well. From the middle of the 14th century, these experimental materials for cuisses were frequently replaced by primitive plate. By the 1380s, the cuisse was often made from one broad piece covering most of the thigh and one or more smaller pieces at the hip. <A href="bword://Arming points">Arming points</A> are provided at the top for the cuisse so that the cuisse can be laced to the arming hose or <A href="bword://gambeson">gambeson</A> . This form of cuisse remained popular during the whole of the 15th century, divided in style according to the <A href="bword://gothic armour">Gothic</A> or <A href="bword://Milanese">Milanese</A> fashion. During the 15th century a wrap plate was also added to the cuisse to defend the back of the thigh, especially as foot combat for knights became more common. <BR>The defense of the knee, the <A href="bword://poleyn">poleyn</A> , was attached either to the cuisse directly (usually before 1350) or <A href="bword://articulation">articulated</A> using <A href="bword://lames">lames</A> to create a moveable joint.

Deaths in Tournament|Death|Deaths	In early <A href="bword://Mêlée">mêlée</A> -style engagements, where the combats took on the form of real combats, there were a number of deaths, sometimes of notable persons. Sometimes these early <A href="bword://Tournament (Tournoi)">tourneys</A> fell into real fighting, where many were slain. Among the famous slain in tournaments:<BR>- Geoffrey, Count of Brittany, Son on Henry II, killed near Paris,1186<BR>- Conrad, son of margrave Dietrich von der Lausitz, 1175<BR>- Leopold, Duke of Austria, slain by a fallen horse in 1194

Defense, knight’s duty of|duty of Defense|knight’s duty|knight’s duty of Defense	A <A href="bword://Knight">knight</A> was to defend both his <A href="bword://Liege">liege</A> lord, and to others who require defense such as ladies, the infirm and poor, children and the old. The two duties began as separate constraints. The first one, defense of the liege lord, is common to all <A href="bword://Feudalism">feudal</A> cultures. All warriors were to defend their lords. The addition of duties extending to ladies, and others in need of defense comes both from the <A href="bword://Romances">romantic</A> literature and from the <A href="bword://Church and Knights">church</A> . Romantic literature added reverence for women to a knight’s duties, while the defense of others was forwarded as a Christian duty by the church. By the late 14th century, both of these influences had successfully added to the knight’s list of virtues and duties.
Degradation from knighthood|Degradation	Because the office of <A href="bword://Knighthood">knighthood</A> was treated with so much regard, taking on aspects of holy devotion, to be forsworn and stripped of knighthood was a purposefully traumatic experience. The <A href="bword://King">king</A> could make the determination to remove knighthood from a man, as could certain <A href="bword://Court">courts</A> . In nearly all instances, the degraded man’s <A href="bword://Spurs">spurs</A> were ‘hacked from his heels’, his <A href="bword://Sword">sword</A> broken (sometimes over his head), his <A href="bword://Cote of Arms">cote of arms</A> burned, and his <A href="bword://Shield (knight's)">shield</A> hung upside down in a <A href="bword://Church and Knights">church</A> or other public place. Often this disgrace was matched with a death sentence, for such knights were often charged with and found guilty of treason. Treason, cowardice, and being forsworn were reasons often cited for the degradation, though it appears to have been rarely used.
Demense	The central part of a <A href="bword://Manor">manorial estate</A> set apart for the <A href="bword://Lord">lord’s</A> own use that provided for the needs of his <A href="bword://Household knights">household</A> . For example, such a demense might contain: a manor house and ‘close’ of small acreage, a pigeon house, a mill, fishery, wood lots containing trees for logging, arable land up to 500 acres or so, meadows for grazing and pasturelands.
Destrier,  Dextrarius|Destrier|Dextrarius	The <A href="http://www.chronique.com/Library/Glossaries/glossary-KCT/gloss_k.htm#knight">knight’s</A> warhorse. The destrier was probably a very powerful breed of horse capable of great strength and good speed and maneuverability. The warhorse was valued anywhere from &pound1 to more than &pound100 during the century, and was a valuable way that commanders paid their troops. In addition to the pay they received, the horses taken on a campaign were divided up amongst the <A href="http://www.chronique.com/Library/Glossaries/glossary-KCT/gloss_n.htm#nobility">nobility</A> and the soldiers, sold or shipped home for additional income. The price of such a horse in modern terms was approximately analogous to an automobile. The best mounts were known as <A href="http://www.chronique.com/Library/Glossaries/glossary-KCT/gloss_c.htm#courser">coursers</A> , and fetched the higher prices. Knights generally rode <A href="http://www.chronique.com/Library/Glossaries/glossary-KCT/gloss_p.htm#palfrey">palfreys</A> between engagements, then mounted their destrier when they were required to be in <A href="http://www.chronique.com/Library/Glossaries/glossary-AA/arms_a.htm#armour">armour</A> , since the palfrey would fare poorly under such great weight, and was a walker more than a hunter, as the destrier seems to have been.
Device (heraldic)|Device|heraldic Device	The symbols displayed to distinguish a <A href="http://www.chronique.com/Library/Glossaries/glossary-KCT/gloss_k.htm#knight">knight</A> on the <A href="bword://Battle (bataille)">battle</A> - or <A href="bword://Tournament (Tournoi)">tournament</A> field. The rules of how such devices could be rendered, called <A href="bword://Heraldry and Heralds">heraldry</A> , was to grow after the 14th century from an ad hoc set of customs to a more rigid set of rules, particular during the early 16th century. Prior to that time, heralds were often associated with the artistic rendering of devices upon <A href="bword://Shield (construction of)">shields</A> , crests, and in record books, but there was no system of registration until the 16th century.
Dieu et Mon Droit	Fr. &quotGod and my Right." <A href="bword://Motto">Motto</A> used by Richard I as a password a the <A href="bword://Battle (bataille)">battle</A> of Gisors. Commemorating this victory, he made it the motto of the Royal House of England.

Dishing	The armouring technique in which metal is worked outwards to form a dish or bowl shape, known also as doming. The process is the most common technique used by modern armourers, and yet thins the metal. <a href="bword://Raising">Raising</A> is the opposite technique, by which the same shapes are attained not by stretching and thinning the metal but by compressing and thickening it. Dishing work is done from the inside and raising from the outside. <BR><BR>
Disparage	To degrade by unequal marriage, as when a man or woman married someone who was not their <A href="bword://Peer">peer</A> --i.e. a <A href="bword://Count">countess</A> marrying a simple <A href="bword://Knight">knight</A> would be considered to be disparaged, and her <A href="bword://Honor">honor</A> reduced accordingly.
Distraint of Knighthood|Distraint	As the office of <A href="bword://Knight">knight</A> became a more costly proposition to uphold, many <A href="bword://Gentleman">gentlemen</A> decided not to accept the <A href="bword://Accolade">accolade</A> of <A href="bword://Knighthood">knighthood</A> , which seemed to carry uneven responsibilities and few additional privileges. By the early 12th century this problem was already acute. Henry III issued a command called the ‘distraint of knighthood’ in order to require all landholders holding a <A href="bword://Knight’s Fee">knight’s fee</A> to be accorded the accolade of knighthood. Such distraints were extended by subsequent monarchs, as in the following example issued by Edward I in 1278: <BR>"...to destrain without delay all those in your bailiwick who have lands worth twenty pounds per year, or one whole knight’s fee worth twenty pounds per year, and hold this in chief and ought to be knights but who are not, to receive from us before Christmas or on that feast the arms of a knight..."

Double-elimination lists	The <A href="bword://Society for Creative Anachronism (SCA)">SCA</A> variant on the medieval <A href="bword://Tournament (Tournoi)">tournament</A> where each combatant may lose two fights before withdrawing from the event. Generally a series of formal single combats, the field is gradually reduced as ‘trees’ of combatants meet and eliminate one another until there are two remaining. These two fight in the finals under a great deal of focus and attention. A purely modern creation, such <A href="bword://List">lists</A> were not used during the middle ages, being most closely related to ‘jousting <A href="bword://Cheques">cheques</A> .’
Double Harness	Reinforced harness for jousting, originating in the 15th century. Although special armours for the joust begin to appear during the 14th century, it was not until the 15th when special harnesses began to have names other than 'armour for the joust.' During the 16th century the <a href="bword://garniture">garniture</A> , or special pieces for the joust, came into wide fashion. Some pieces of fine garnitures remain in the Royal Armouries collection and in several Continental museums. <BR><BR>

Duke	The highest title of <A href="bword://Nobility">nobility</A> in England, ranking below the <A href="bword://Prince">prince</A> , introduced for the first time by Edward III when bestowing various <A href="bword://Castle">castles</A> and estates in Cornwall to his son, the Black Prince. The title, imported from the continent, originally meant a military commander, and the English retained this etymology by endowing English dukes with special fees in war, where command expertise was expected. In Germany, the title ‘Herzog’ was equivalent, though they were often elected and carried more administrative and social duties than military ones. A duke is properly addressed as ‘<A href="http://www.chronique.com/Library/Glossaries/glossary-KCT/gloss_g.htm#grace, your">your grace</A> ’, equivalent to the rank of archbishop in the church hierarchy. <BR>Within the SCA the title is reserved for those gentles who have served twice as king of an SCA kingdom, won through the Crown Tournament. They are know by coronets bearing strawberry leaves in the familiar three leaf patterm, ranking just below the Princes of the realm.
Durendal	The mystical <A href="bword://Sword">sword</A> of <A href="bword://Count">count</A> Roland, famous from the <A href="bword://Song of Roland">Song of Roland</A> (chanson de Roland) and from the <A href="bword://Chanson d'Aspremont">Chanson d’Aspremont</A> .
Démesuré|Demesure	Fr. Sinful pride, as distinct from ordinary <A href="bword://Pride">pride</A> , which results in extraordinary cost. Roland was labeled with this flaw in the <A href="bword://Song of Roland">Chanson de Roland</A> , when he refused to withdraw in the face of overwhelming odds because his pride would not allow him to flee. As a result he and the men with him were slain.
Earl	Derived from the early Anglo-Saxon, the office of Earl was to administer a <A href="bword://Shire">shire</A> . Over time, the number of these administrators was reduced, but the holdings by each earldom increased, such that by the time of Edward I the title was the highest ranking nobility in England next to the <A href="bword://Prince">princes</A> , until Edward III supplanted the title by creating a duchy for his son the Black Prince in Cornwall. Equivalent to the county on the continent, English earls were often styled as such when they went abroad, in reality carrying similar duties and prestige. <BR>Within the <A href="bword://Society for Creative Anachronism (SCA)">SCA</A> the title is reserved for those gentles who have served once as king of an <A href="bword://Kingdom, SCA">SCA kingdom</A> .

Etching|engraving, painting,	The technique by which a form of wax or resist is placed onto the metal surfaced and scraped off in preparation for an acid bath (generally nitric acid or a mix of nitric, sulfuric acids and water). The resulting effect is to quickly remove metal and produce a striking visual effect. Used most often during the 16th and 17th centuries, there are only scattered references from the 14th and 15th centuries, although the technique appears in common use in jewelry and art metal. Most decoration during these periods was restricted to <a href="bword://engraving">engraving</A> , <a href="bword://painting">painting</A> ,or studding.<BR>
Excalibur	King Arthur’s <A href="bword://Sword">sword</A> , also known in Geoffrey of Monmouth as Caliburn. There is no historical evidence for or against such a sword, and the role of the blade varies wildly in the <A href="bword://Romances">romances</A> . In the most common appearances, the Lady of the Lake gives the sword to Arthur, though in modern renditions the sword is often taken from the stone, a twist on the blade of Balin of the Two Swords, which Merlin placed into the stone, eventually drawn by Galahad (Malory). Before dying, Arthur instructed Bedevere to throw the blade back into the lake, when a hand caught it and took it beneath the waves. In the <A href="bword://Vulgate Cycle">Vulgate Cycle</A> , Arthur requires this service of Girflet, who twice tries to fool Arthur into believing that he has so dispensed the blade, but is caught both times, eventually following the command and throwing it as instructed. The sword was given to have various magical powers: healing, etc., as was the scabbard, which was to make Arthur impervious to mortal blows so long as he retained it in his possession.

After that, a narrow slit was generally provided to allow vision but to restrict weapons. On bascinet <a href="bword://Visor">visors</A> ,the area around the eyes was raised outward to make it very difficult for a weapon, or more importantly, an arrow to find purchase on the iron and penetrate.<BR><BR><BR>
Fabric, common types in arming applications|Fabric|arming applications fabric|common types of fabric in arming applications	Linen was the most common material for aketons, gambesons, and arming clothes. <a href="bword://Silk">Silk</A> was also used, and there is a tale that says that this is because silk against the skin has a tendency to restrict the damage of a wound. Wool also appears to have been common for <a href="bword://Cote Armour, jupon">cotes</A> and overclothes, though few examples of arming clothes remain save for the cote of the Black Prince, in Canterbury Cathedral; the jupon of Charles the Bold; and a <a href="bword://pourpoint">pourpoint</A> from the 15th century held in the Kienbusch collection, Philadelphia.
Fair	Important markets for the sale of goods, generally temporary gatherings of merchants, farmers and artificers, the most powerful of which were held in the <a href="bword://Borough">boroughs</A>. <BR>
Faith	For anyone in the Middle Ages, faith was a cornerstone element of their lives, without which the struggle and privations. For a medieval person, life on earth was but a brief transition to the afterlife in heaven, hell or purgatory. A <A href="bword://Knight">knight</A> was expected to have faith in his God, in his ability, his <A href="bword://Prowess">prowess</A> and in his <A href="bword://Renown">renown</A> . For re-enactors, faith must be held not so much in religious conviction, though that is certainly helpful, but in the <A href="bword://Chivalry, the">order of chivalry</A> as a while, in the value of <A href="bword://Knighthood">knighthood</A> to striving towards being a better human being. Lastly, faith in the other combatants, in their <A href="bword://Chivalry">chivalry</A> , in their sincerity.

Falconry	The art of hunting with birds of prey, hawks, falcons and sometimes eagles. It was considered a <A href="bword://Nobility">noble</A> pursuit, a sport, during the middle ages, the perquisite of the noble classes. There were sumptuary laws dictating which birds could be carried by nobles at various ranks; it was a matter of great prestige and expense.

Fealty	Obligation of fidelity in a military, political and social sense on the part of a <A href="bword://Feudalism">feudal</A> tenant or <A href="bword://Vassal">vassal</A> to his <A href="bword://Lord">lord</A> . The contract is not to be confused with <A href="bword://Homage">homage</A> , though both ceremonies were conducted at the same time. In the first part of the ceremony, where the <A href="bword://Liegeman">liegeman</A> swore personal homage to the lord, they swore to ‘become his man’. The lord swore an <A href="bword://Oath">oath</A> of his own where he pledged protection and defense for the tenant. During the second part of the ceremony, only the liegeman swore the oath, swearing to perform faithful service for the land so tendered. Called foi in French, Treue or Triuwe in German.
Feast of the Peacock	{}
Feast of the Swan	22 May 1306. Event at which Edward I, <A href="bword://King">king</A> of England, <A href="bword://Knight">knighted</A> his son Edward II at Westminster Abbey. The <A href="bword://Prince">prince</A> served his vigil, was knighted in private by the <A href="bword://King">king</A> , and then himself knighted the other 260 men who were accorded the <A href="bword://Accolade">accolade</A> at the same time. At the feast following, the king had two swans brought in, swearing ‘before God and the swans’ to ‘avenge the death John Comyn of Badenock and to fight the infidels in the <A href="bword://Holy Lands">Holy Land</A> . John was slain by Robert Bruce earlier in the year. The event inspired the <A href="bword://Vow of the Heron">Vow of the Heron</A> , at which Robert d’Artois and Edward III make their vows concerning the upcoming war with France. Such vows were common elements of <A href="bword://Chivalry">chivalric</A> custom, a binding agent given a focal point for chivalric <A href="bword://Feat of Arms">feats of arms</A> .
Feat of Arms	A display of <A href="bword://Prowess">prowess</A> , usually with a variety of arms, often involving both combats on horseback and on foot. Sometimes held as a <A href="bword://Pas d’Armes">pas d’armes</A> or as an <A href="bword://Emprise">emprise</A> .
Fechtbuch	{}

Feoffment	A form granting conveying a fee. Generally the recipient of the fee received a branch or clod of dirt as a symbolic gesture.
Ferrant	Steel gray color for a horse, frequently referring to a warhorse or a <A href="bword://Courser">courser</A> .
Ferrite	A non-metallic, ceramic-like compound of ferric oxide found in iron<BR>
Ferrous	Metal derived from iron ore--pig-iron, cast-iron, steel<BR><BR>
Feudal Levy	The army available to a <A href="bword://Lord">lord</A> resulting from the obligations to field a number of <A href="bword://Knight">knights</A> and <A href="bword://Man-at-Arms">men-at-arms</A> in exchange for the land and it’s income. This military service was the mainstay of medieval forces until the middle of the 14th century, consisting generally of 40 days military service in the field or as a <A href="bword://Castle">castle</A> guard. The <A href="bword://Liegeman">liegeman</A> would usually appear as required, with the type of warhorse, armament and attendants specified in the contract, or he could pay <A href="bword://Scutage">scutage</A> to avoid the service. <BR>By the middle of the 14th century, fewer and fewer knights were appearing for their service, preferring to pay scutage instead, with which the lord could hire mercenary knights to serve. With the <A href="bword://Hundred Years War">Hundred Years War</A> , the monarchs required longer campaigns, so they began to pay their troops with <A href="bword://Booty">booty</A> and with paid service. Many unattached knights, who don’t own their own manor, would hire on in for a campaign in the hopes of receiving valuable horses, riches, <A href="bword://Ransom">ransoms</A> and other booty in exchange for their service. Gradually the feudal obligation fell on and professional armies were increased.
Feudal System	{}
Feudalism	{}
Fief	A unit of land held by a <A href="bword://Vassal">vassal</A> from a <A href="bword://Lord">lord</A> in return for military service. Fiefs were conferred in an original grant, a grant which stipulated the conditions under which it could be transferred by marriage, inheritance, or under what conditions it would fall into default.
Fief-rent	The amount of <A href="bword://Money">money</A> , annual taxes, due for a <A href="bword://Fief">fief</A> to the <A href="bword://Liege">liege</A> lord, generally either a percentage of the total production or a flat amount.
Field	The surface on a <A href="bword://Heraldry and Heralds">heraldic</A> <A href="bword://Shield (construction of)">shield</A> , the base <A href="bword://Color">color</A> or <A href="bword://Metal">metal</A> upon which the primary chief or division is placed upon.
Field of the Cloth of Gold	{}
Fin Amours	A particular term for the conception of love held by the Provençal troubadors, often used interchangeably with <A href="bword://Courtly Love">courtly love</A> .
Fine	See <A href="bword://Scutage">scutage</A> .
Fire-bote	The rights of tenants to take firewood from a <A href="bword://Lord">lord’s</A> <A href="bword://Demense">demense</A> , often granted if the tenant’s land held no forest.
Fisher King	The keeper of the <A href="bword://Grail, Graal">grail</A> , the wounded <A href="bword://King">king</A> who must be asked the critical question, ‘What ails thee, sire?’. When Percival fails to ask this question, the grail is initially denied to him and the quest for the grail must be undertaken.
Flank	The end of a military line, a weak point on one side or the other. Traditionally, the attacker’s right flank is weaker than the left, because the <A href="bword://Shield (construction of)">shield</A> is generally wielded in the left hand. To gain an enemy’s flank is a common tactical objective, because the unit so engaged is then pressed on more than one front, and the resulting confusion can often destroy a unit or army’s cohesion.
Flaring	The pressing of metal so that a lip or tail is formed into a compound curve with a concave shape, similar to the mouth of a vase. This technique is essential to making fine quality pieces that are free from the modern danger of being to flat. <a href="bword://Barbute">Barbutes</A> , <a href="bword://Greaves, shynbalds">greaves</A> , <a href="bword://crinet">crinets</A> , <a href="bword://gauntlet">gauntlet</A> cuffs, and <a href="bword://vambrace">vambraces</A> all feature a good deal of flaring, making them difficult to execute. Without doubt flaring is one of the more difficult things for an armourer to learn, but it improves the quality of the resulting pieces by many times. <BR><BR>
Florentine	In terms of <A href="bword://Society for Creative Anachronism (SCA)">SCA</A> combat, fighting done with two <A href="bword://Broadsword">broadswords</A> rather than a <A href="bword://Sword" arms_s.htm#sword? glossary-AA Glossaries Library www.chronique.com http:>sword</A> and <A href="bword://Shield (construction of)">shield</A> . Also known as ‘two sword’, the combatant fights with a broadsword, generally matched, in each hand. There is debate in SCA circles concerning whether or not this style should be allowed in <A href="bword://Tournament (Tournoi)">tournaments</A> , based on the very limited documentation as to its actual use. No known instances of such a style used in tournaments have yet been found, though there are scattered Icelandic and <A href="bword://Romances">romantic</A> references to the use of two swords. The most famous example is not European; Miamoto Musashi, the famous oriental author of the Book of Five Rings, was known to fight with two wooden swords. <BR>In terms of fighting technique, flourentine can either be very elegant or very choppy, depending upon the fighting style of the combatant. By giving up the shield and using the swords to block, a combatant wielding two swords gives up defensive capability in exchange for offensive power. Though important for any combatant, keeping the initiative is even more important for a two-swordsman. Because he does not have the defensive leisure or margin of error available to a sword and shieldman, he must seize the initiative and make the fight his own if he expects to succeed. <BR>Originally, the word ‘flourentine’ meant one who came from the Italian city Florence. During the 16th century the word came to be applied to a rapier and main gauche style of combat popular in the city, hence the SCA reference. See also <A href="http://www.chronique.com/Chronique/chrniq15.htm">Chronique, the Journal of Chivalry #15</A> and the essay <A href="http://www.chronique.com/Library/Fighting/2sword.htm">Two-Sword in SCA combat</A> .

Funerary Brass	See <a href="bword://Brass (funerary brass)">Brass, Funerary</A>
Gallery	The audience watching a <A href="bword://Tournament (Tournoi)">tournament</A> , or the structure from which the audience watched a tourney. From the 12th to the 14th century, these were generally informal places such as a hillside or a pavilion where ladies, courtiers and <A href="bword://Heraldry and Heralds">heralds</A> could watch the engagement, but during the 15th century as the splendor of the tournament created a more elaborate pageant, wooden structures similar to &quotbox seats" were built and decorated with fabric. Such galleries are common in the illustrations of King René d’Anjou’s Livre de Tournoi from the middle 15th century.

Garniture	During the 16th century a concept was introduced by which a field <A href="bword://harness">harness</A> was fitted with an additional 20 - 40 pieces of equipment so that the same armour could be used for war, specialized tournaments, and the joust. Specialized armour for the tourney became increasingly expensive during the 15th and 16th century, although there are records of specialized armour pieces in wardrobe accounts of the 14th century.
Garter, Order of the	{}
Gatehouse	A building forming the gate of a <A href="bword://Castle">castle</A> , generally encompassing a narrow passageway with several gates. Often the gatehouses were fitted with arrow-slits, murder-holes, or other ingenious defensive devices designed to wreck havoc upon the <A href="bword://Siege">besiegers</A> as they attempted to storm the gates. Some gatehouses held lodgings for guards with rooms for officers above and prisoners below.
Gatlings	The small joint defense on a finger <A href="bword://gauntlet">gauntlet</A> , usually attached to a <A href="bword://leather">leather</A> or canvas base by sewing or by <A href="bword://rivets">rivets</A> . They might have been of <A href="bword://iron">iron</A> or <A href="bword://latten">latten</A> ; there is evidence for both. Some of these gatlings might have been cast into creature heads or other forms, such as the acorn, which was a very popular motif. See the gauntlets in the <A href="bword://Bargello collection">Bargello collection</A> and numerous <A href="bword://brass">brasses</A> for more detail.
Gauntlet	The armour to defend the hand. Prior to the 14th century, the hand was defended with a <A href="http://www.chronique.com/Library/Glossaries/glossary-AA/arms_m.htm#mail">mail</A> mitten. During the first half of the 14th century, gauntlets were introduced formed of small plates <A href="http://www.chronique.com/Library/Glossaries/glossary-AA/arms_r.htm#rivets">riveted</A> to <A href="http://www.chronique.com/Library/Glossaries/glossary-AA/arms_l.htm#leather">leather</A> or cloth, what we call a brigandine gauntlet. Only a few examples survive, all from the Battle of Wisby find dating from 1361. By the middle of the 14th century, the &quothourglass" gauntlet had been developed, where the <A href="http://www.chronique.com/Library/Glossaries/glossary-AA/arms_c.htm#cuff">cuff</A> <A href="http://www.chronique.com/Library/Glossaries/glossary-AA/arms_f.htm#flaring">flared</A> to allow some wrist movement. Often the <A href="http://www.chronique.com/Library/Glossaries/glossary-AA/arms_m.htm#metacarpal">metacarpal</A> (back of the hand) and the cuff were decorated with additional pieces in brass or bronze, and also by <A href="http://www.chronique.com/Library/Glossaries/glossary-AA/arms_e.htm#engraving">engraving</A> . The fingers were defended either by scaled defenses and sometimes by <A href="http://www.chronique.com/Library/Glossaries/glossary-AA/arms_g.htm#gatlings">gatlings</A> , which were like <A href="http://www.chronique.com/Library/Glossaries/glossary-AA/arms_p.htm#poleyn">poleyns</A> for the finger knuckles. <BR>There are some references, most notably the Battle of San Romano, which indicate that this style of gauntlet might have been used, at least in Italy, into the second or even the third quarter of the 15th century. During the 15th century, this &quotfinger gauntlet" style was replaced in the <A href="http://www.chronique.com/Library/Glossaries/glossary-AA/arms_m.htm#Milanese">Milanese</A> style with a three-piece <A href="http://www.chronique.com/Library/Glossaries/glossary-AA/arms_m.htm#mitten gauntlet">&quotmitten" gauntlet</A> that replaced the finger scales with two <A href="bword://articulation">articulating</A> <A href="bword://lames">lames</A> that provided more protection but less mobility. The cuff was extended and straightened, losing the flare of the hourglass gauntlet. In the German style, the cuff was also extended, but the plates were ornately <A href="bword://fluting">fluted</A> and <A href="bword://armour, decoration of">decorated</A> with piercework. The <A href="bword://gothic armour">Gothic</A> gauntlet is made from many small plates intricately articulated together with a mixture of sliding and pivoting rivets. The fingers were still articulated using gatlings and scales. <BR>During the 16th century, this style was generalized into a more international style where the gothic cuff was shortened, the metacarpal created from as many as fifteen plates, and the fingers done in scale. A minor variant, the &quotlocking" mitten , was designed for tournament use during the 16th century. No earlier examples survive, though there are references in manuscripts from the middle 14th century that mention such locking gauntlets.

Generosity	See <A href="bword://Largesse">largesse</A> .
Gentleman	A man who bore arms through grant or inheritance. The word derived from the ‘gentle’ qualities that were supposed to belong to the upper class, the refined sense of <A href="bword://Nobility">nobility</A> grown from both noble descent and education. To be ‘gentle’ in the medieval sense meant that a man must be born to the class, he could not become ‘gentle’ by deed.

Gothic armour was generally <A href="bword://cap à pied">cap à pied</A> armour, very light for full <A href="bword://harness">harness</A> , featuring a <A href="bword://sallet">sallet</A> and <A href="bword://bevor">bevor</A> for the defense of the head. Contrast this with the more curved and softer <A href="bword://Milanese">Milanese</A> armour produced on the Italian peninsula.
Grace	An essential virtue not necessarily of <a href="bword://Knighthood">knighthood</A>, but of <a href="bword://Nobility">nobility</A>. Remember that in the Middle Ages the question of nobility was two-fold; on one hand a man had to be born into nobility, because people believed that there was a strong heredity component to human behavior. Certain virtues were expected of members of the nobility or the aristocracy because they were different from the lesser folk. On of the virtues expected was grace, the quality that combined tact, <a href="bword://Courtesy">courtesy</A>, good judgment,and respect for others into a single ‘graceful’ nature that was only possible with a mature, virtuous soul.
Grace, Your|Your	Formal title of address for archbishops, <A href="bword://Duke">dukes</A> , <A href="bword://Prince">princes</A> or even <A href="bword://King">kings</A> , used such as ‘your grace.’
Graf	German title equivalent of <A href="bword://Count">count</A> .
Grail, Graal|Graal|Grail	The cup of the last supper in which Joseph of Arimithea caught the blood of crucified Christ. It was, by legend, carried to Britain where it was hidden, entrusted to Joseph’s descendants, ending with Galahad. The search for the grail quest has become a metaphor for man’s search for purity and <A href="bword://Grace">grace</A> ; the search for the grail forms the center of many Arthurian romances as the <A href="bword://Knight">knights</A> strive to overcome flaws in their own character to achieve grace. This quest, laid out best in Wolfram von Eshenbach’s Parsifal and the <A href="bword://Vulgate Cycle">Vulgate Cycle</A> , has been echoed many times. <BR>However, there are contentions that the grail is not a cup at all; indeed that there is some dispute concerning whether medieval authors had any consensus to claim that it was a cup. See <A href="http://www.chronique.com/Library/Knights/Grail.htm">What is the Grail?</A> analysis from Dr.Linda A. Malcor <I>THE CHALICE AT THE CROSS.</I>
Grand Company of the Peacocks	The <A href="bword://Society for Creative Anachronism (SCA)">SCA</A> <A href="bword://Tournament (Tournoi)">tournament</A> team based in the Middle <A href="bword://kingdom, SCA">Kingdom</A> , a late 14th century group whose colors are <A href="bword://Azure">azure</A> and <A href="bword://Vert">vert</A> , the colors of the Peacock. They were instrumental in bringing about interest in the Middle Kingdom to the historical tournament concept, working closely with the <A href="bword://Tenans of Noble Folly">Tenans of Noble Folly</A> to experiment with the <A href="bword://René-style Tournament">King René tournament</A> format in the SCA context. The group boasts a wide base of artistic talent, which is evidenced by their fine equipment and <A href="bword://Harness">harness</A> .

Gratz Armoury	The armour collection at Gratz, Austria, featuring one of the most extensive collections of 16th and 17th century armours in existence. The armoury represents a nearly intact municipal armoury, the only one of its kind. Only the <A href="bword://Tower of London">Tower of London</A> has maintained a similar arsenal.
Great bascinet	A late 14th early 15th century version of the <A href="bword://bascinet">bascinet</A> where the <A href="bword://mail">mail</A> <A href="bword://aventail">aventail</A> was replaced with two <A href="bword://steel">steel</A> plates, one in the front and one in back. During the middle 15th century these helmets were still in tournament use, fitted with grilles, adorned with brilliant <A href="bword://torse">torses</A> , <A href="bword://mantling">mantles</A> and crests for the pageants sponsored by rich noblemen such as King René d'Anjou. See <A href="http://www.chronique.com/Chronique/chrniq10.htm">Chronique, The Journal of Chivalry #10</A>
Great Company	A huge mercenary army that formed in 1361, largely formed of English soldiers displaced by the lull in fighting during the <A href="bword://Hundred Years War">Hundred Years War</A> . The international contingent moved through France, pillaging and capturing fortress after fortress until Charles V appealed to Edward III for assistance. Charles sent Bertrand de Guesclin, the army moved to Castile, where they deposed the <A href="bword://King">king</A> despite the efforts of the Black Prince.
Greatsword	(See <A href="bword://Claymore">Claymore</A> )
Greaves,  shynbalds|Greave|Greaves|shynbald|shynbalds	Plate defenses for the lower leg also called. They first appear on <A href="bword://brass">brasses</A> during the second quarter of the 14th century, and remain a standard defense for the lower leg for more than two centuries. The greaves were shaped, <A href="bword://flaring">flared</A> and <A href="bword://dishing">dished</A> to match the shape of the calf and ankle. One of the more difficult pieces of armour to create, the greave adds a very elegant look to any reproduction <A href="bword://harness">harness</A>
Green Knight	The giant who challenges Gawain to an exchange of single blows, testing his virtue and his <A href="bword://Prowess">prowess</A> .
Greyhound	Generic term for any medieval hunting-dog.
Grille	A rare form of <A href="bword://visor">visor</A> , a defense for the face, most commonly used on tournament <A href="bword://helmet">helmets</A> of the 15th century. The only surviving grilles are fitted onto <A href="bword://great bascinet">great bascinets</A> ; such are amply described in King Rene d'Anjou's book on the tournament. There is a single example of a center mount <A href="bword://bascinet">bascinet</A> from the middle 14th century on a Bohemian altarpiece, c. 1360, the bears a grille as defense. The grille has become a standard defense in the <A href="http://www.sca.org/">SCA</A> , where modern re-enactors prefer the vision and breathing capability, not having to worry about sheared lances or the points of <A href="bword://sword">swords</A>
Guidon	Another word for the <A href="bword://Pennant">pennant</A> of a <A href="bword://Bachelier">bachelor-knight</A> .

Gules	<A href="bword://Heraldry and Heralds">Heraldic</A> color for red.
Halidon Hill, Battle of|Battle of Halidon Hill|Halidon Hill	1333. Edward III’s <A href="bword://Battle (bataille)">battle</A> against David Bruce, where his forces, outnumbered, dismounted and held the top of the hill, flanked by <A href="bword://Archer">archers</A> hidden in bramble and marsh. As the Scots, following their French advisors and experience, charged up the hill, they were destroyed both by the archers and the dismounted English <A href="bword://Infantry">infantry</A> . In this single battle, Edward was able to destroy the bulk of the Scots army and secure for himself both his northern border an the title ‘king of Scotland’, which enabled him to turn his attention to France. It is often called the first battle in the <A href="http://www.chronique.com/Library/Glossaries/glossary-KCT/gloss_h.htm#Hundred Years War">Hundred Years War</A> . The tactics he tried and used with great success at Halidon hill he and his son the Black Prince used again and again with success at <A href="bword://Crècy, Battle of">Crècy</A> and <A href="bword://Poitiers, Battle of">Poitiers</A> ; Henry V used them yet again at <A href="bword://Agincourt, Battle of">Agincourt</A> .
Hammer (armourer's tool)|Hammer|armourer's tool	The predominant tool of the <A href="bword://armourer">armourer</A> . Similar in shape to the silversmithing hammers, armourer's hammers are normally 2-3 times heavier than a similar tool used to work silver. An even and accurate hammer stroke is necessary to the production of crisp interpretations. Modern armourers can acquire such tools through some blacksmithing supply houses or from European toolmakers such as Peddinghouse. Sometimes old hammers can be acquired, and modified if necessary to do the required task. A modern armourer will have from between 20 and 100 hammers that they use regularly, with most preferring 2 to 5 for most of the work and the rest serving specialized purposes. These are often bought from tool collectors or modifies to solve a particular problem. See <A href="http://www.chronique.com/Chronique/chrniq06.htm">Chronique: The Journal of Chivalry #6</A> .
Hammer (warhammer),  Martel, Horseman's Pick|Hammer|Horseman's Pick|Martel|warhammer	A weapon consisting of a hammer head on one side and a spike on the other, sometimes mounted on a short handle for use in one hand and other times mounted on a short shaft for use in foot combats. Warhammers and poleaxes were popularly used in judicial duels or in combats associated with points of honor.

Harness	The generic description for a man-at-arms defensive gear, including undergarments, armoured elements, and integral equipment such as <A href="bword://spur">spurs</A> , <A href="bword://sword">sword</A> , etc.. Field harnesses were armours of war, designed for use in the field. During the 14th century some specialization in armour was begun, where tournament gear first begins to be separated from field harness in inventory records. There may well have been <A href="bword://leather">leather</A> gear also, used for practice, but this might not have proved valuable enough to record, though <A href="bword://armour, decoration of">decorated</A> tournament gear of leather was often recorded.
Hastilude	Literally a ‘<A href="bword://Spear">spear</A> game’. Often used as a generic form for <A href="bword://Tournament (Tournoi)">tournaments</A> , or a "<A href="bword://Mêlée">mêlée</A> " form where <A href="bword://Knight">knights</A> fought as integrated groups called <A href="bword://Conroi">conroi</A> to practice their unit skills and to capture their opponents and thus capture their horses and equipment. Sir William Marshal was perhaps the pre-eminent tourneyer in the day of the hastilude, but after his death in the early 13th century the tournament became more and more regulated, becoming a very structured pageant by the 16th century when Henry VIII and Françis I of France held the Field of the Cloth of Gold, C. 1515.
Hastings, Battle of|Battle of Hastings|Hastings	October 14, 1066. Decisive <A href="http://www.chronique.com/Library/Glossaries/glossary-KCT/gloss_b.htm#battle">battle</A> between the English forces of Harold Godwineson, <A href="http://www.chronique.com/Library/Glossaries/glossary-KCT/gloss_k.htm#king">king</A> of England, and William I, <A href="http://www.chronique.com/Library/Glossaries/glossary-KCT/gloss_d.htm#duke">duke</A> of Normandy. Harold’s forces were exhausted, on foot, having marched from a victorious battle against <A href="http://www.chronique.com/Library/Glossaries/glossary-KCT/gloss_c.htm#cavalry">cavalry</A> in September 26. Drawing the <A href="http://www.chronique.com/Library/Glossaries/glossary-KCT/arms_s.htm#shield">shield</A> men into a line across the top of the hill, William’s cavalry threw themselves against the wall to no avail. Finally, the cavalry retreated in apparent disorder, through a ruse, and fell upon Harold’s now disogranized foot as they pursued in search of <A href="http://www.chronique.com/Library/Glossaries/glossary-KCT/gloss_b.htm#booty">booty</A> . Harold himself took an arrow to the eye, and William was able to march into England, establishing a Norman conquest leaving an indelible mark on English culture. The battle also reinforced the medieval belief in the superiority of mounted cavalry against foot, delaying the experimentation of medieval armies with mixed forces until the late 14th century.
Haubergen	A shorter version of the <A href="bword://hauberk">hauberk</A> , a shirt made of <A href="bword://mail">mail</A> , usually laced down the sides ofter 1300.
Hauberk	A <A href="bword://mail">mail</A> shirt, generally extending down to defend the legs. The hauberk was the main defense for both body and legs until the late 13th century, when armourers began to experiment with reinforcing using padded, <A href="bword://courboille">courboille</A> , and even rudimentary <A href="bword://plate">plate</A> augmentations.
Head, defense of|defense of head|head	Generally a helmet was used to defend the head; a camail and <A href="bword://casque">casque</A> or <A href="bword://heaulm">heaulm</A> prior to the 14th century; a <A href="bword://bascinet">bascinet</A> , <A href="bword://cervèllaire">cervèllaire</A> , <A href="bword://sugarloaf">sugarloaf</A> , <A href="bword://heaulm">heaulm</A> or <A href="bword://chapel de fer">chapel de fer</A> during the 14th century; a <A href="bword://barbute">barbute</A> , <A href="bword://sallet">sallet</A> , <A href="bword://armet">armet</A> or <A href="bword://great bascinet">great bascinet</A> during the 15th century; an armet or close helmet during the 16th century.

Heat treating	The processes through which armour is <A href="bword://Hardness">hardened</A> through heating. In general, most <A href="bword://iron">iron</A> or <A href="bword://ferrous">ferrous</A> armour is hardened either through work hardening (done by <A href="bword://Hammer (armourer's tool)">hammering</A> ) or by heating it to its critical temperature (dependent upon the technique used) and then quenched in water, urine, oil or other more secret substances. Prior to the 14th century, most hardened pieces were worked, <A href="bword://planishing">planished</A> , from the <A href="bword://Hammer (armourer's tool)">hammer</A> rather than heat treated. During the 15th century, there is some evidence that the German armourers, particularly in Augsburg, began to use a sophisticated two step method that achieved a superior <A href="bword://hardness">hardness</A> and a resiliance to <A href="bword://brittleness">brittleness</A> . See especially Theodore Monnich's article in <A href="http://www.chronique.com/Chronique/chrniq13.htm">Chronique: The Journal of Chivalry #13</A> .

Heaulm, Helm, Great Helm|Great Helm|Heaulm|Helm	A fully enclosed defense for the head developed during the 12th century. Known also as the &quotbarrel" or &quotpot" helmet (modern terms), the heaulm was generally made from several smaller sheets of <A href="bword://steel">steel</A> , completely covering the face. From manuscript accounts it appears that they were often painted in the colors of the knight, and might also have been washed in gold or adorned with brass, bronze or <A href="bword://latten">latten</A> decor, generally in the form of a cross under the <A href="bword://occularia">occularia</A> and down the front of the face.
Heilbronn Ordinances, 1485|Heilbronn Ordinances|Heilbronn Ordinances 1485	Written by four German <A href="bword://Tournament Society">tournament societies</A> , the Ordinances set our moral guidelines for tournament participants, they dictate that members who fail to keep the ordinances be penalized by being ‘put on the barrier’; beaten, unhorsed, his saddle put astride the barrier, where he was forced to sit.

Heraldry and Heralds|Heraldry|Heralds	The rules by which a <A href="bword://Knight">knight’s</A> symbols were organized for clarity and individuality. Heralds, as officers of the <A href="bword://Court">court</A> , were originally followers of the <A href="bword://Tournament (Tournoi)">tournament</A> , moving with the tournament circuit form place to place and originally paid along with jongleurs and <A href="bword://Minstrel">minstrels</A> . They were thus entertainers first, but during the 15th and 16th century they gradually absorbed the duties of court officers, carrying messages, and even negotiating between warring parties. See also <A href="http://www.chronique.com/Chronique/chrniq10.htm">Chronique: The Journal of Chivalry #10</A> .
Heresy	An opinion held in opposition to the orthodox doctrine in the Christian church, a crime by medieval law punishable by death. Heretical opinions were examined by <A href="bword://Church Courts">church courts</A> , which could pass sentence and carry out the resulting justice. Notable examples of medieval heresies were the teachings of John Wycliffe, the teachings of the Lollards. The <A href="bword://Inquisition">Inquisition</A> was instituted in 13th century France, a tool used during the 14th century to purge the <A href="bword://Templar, Knights (Knights of the Temple)">Templars</A> from their extensive holdings in France and in most of Europe, most of their members being burned.
Hertzog	See <A href="bword://Duke">Duke</A> .

Hobelars	Light <A href="bword://Cavalry">cavalry</A> who wore a light steel cap, a short coat of <A href="bword://Mail">mail</A> , using either a short <A href="bword://Sword">sword</A> , light <A href="bword://Lance (weapon used in the joust)">lance</A> , or bow. Such troops were in common use in Scotland, but additionally Edward III used them with great effect during the Battle for <A href="bword://Calais">Calais</A> in 1347.
Hohenzeuggestech	A form of <A href="bword://Joust">joust</A> popular in Germany during the Late 14th century. Using a special saddle that raised the <A href="bword://Knight">knight</A> ten inches or more above the horses back, the idea was to splinter <A href="bword://Lance (weapon used in the joust)">lances</A> . The sport proved dangerous, with many broken thighs and backs a result.
Holy Grail	See <A href="bword://Grail, Graal">grail</A> .
Holy Lands	Western Palestine, especially Judea, the historical lands of the bible. The ‘recovery’ of the Holy Lands from the governance of the Muslims was the goal of the First, Third and Children’s <A href="bword://Crusade">crusades</A> . The success of the first crusade drove the <A href="http://www.chronique.com/Library/Glossaries/glossary-KCT/gloss_s.htm#Saracen">Saracens</A> from the holy lands and allowed the Christian forces to establish the Kingdom of Jerusalem, new land that have opportunity for young <A href="bword://Knight">knights</A> and provided a new pilgrimage destination considered an extremely holy destination.
Holy Roman Empire	A new instance of the old Roman empire in the West, the Empire was established in 962 under Otto I, a reincarnation of Charlemagne’s old empire established in 800. The Empire was what we today consider modern day Germany, the ‘Emperor’ being elected by the German <A href="bword://Prince">princes</A> , holding land in both Germany and Italy.
Homage	The public pronouncement of a <A href="bword://Vassal">vassal</A> to his <A href="bword://Lord">lord</A> where he swore to become ‘his man’, an <A href="bword://Oath">oath</A> that carried a promise of loyalty. The homage ceremony, accomplished by placing the vassal’s hands into that of the lord. In exchange, the lord pledged to protect and defend the vassal. The ceremony was distinct from, but often a part of, a <A href="bword://Oath of Fealty">fealty oath</A> , wherein the vassal pledged to do a specified service in exchange for the land of <A href="bword://Fief">fief</A> . Both were highly personal and powerful oaths, which were meant to bind lord and vassal together.<BR>- <A href="http://www.chronique.com/Library/Knights/coronation.htm#homage">15th century royal oath of homage</A> (1365-1480)
Honi Soit Qui Mal y Pense	‘Shame to he who thinks bad of it.’ The <A href="bword://Motto">motto</A> of the <A href="bword://Garter, Order of the">Order of the Garter</A> , which has come, in popular legend, to refer to an illicit affair by the founder of the Order, Edward III, with the Countess of Salisbury. While it is reasonably certain that Edward did indeed conduct affairs, there is no hard evidence to support the use of the garter as a token of his affection for her.
Honor	Honor is not a virtue. It is the essential quality that accrues to a man when other people view them as being virtuous--i.e. they honor them. The drive for honor earns a <A href="bword://Knight">knight</A> or <A href="bword://Man-at-Arms">man-at-arms</A> <A href="bword://Renown">renown</A> , his fame, his good name. It is always a very strong motivator for some soldiers. Honor in a personal sense is often confused with such ‘public’ honor, but I say rather that this is not honor but integrity.
Hors de Combat	Fr. Out of the fighting; unable to continue.
Horse, defense of|Horse|defense of Horse	Prior to the 14th century, horses were generally defended only by <A href="bword://mail">mail</A> . During the late 14th century, there are records of horse armour but there are no surviving examples. Full plate defenses were occasionally used during the 15th and 16th centuries, although usually only a <A href="bword://crinet">crinet</A> and <A href="bword://chamfron">chamfron</A> were used.
Horse, use of|Horse|use of Horse	For most of the medieval period, the knight and horse combination formed the most awesome force the battlefield had ever seen. Using the stirrup and saddle, the knight and his fifty pounds of armour would bear down on the opponents with a heavy <a href="bword://lance">lance</A> .The key to this attack was for a group of knights to charge closely together, the effect of which would completely unnerve the defenders and break up any who remained. Because this technique required such careful coordination, tournaments were begun during the 12th century. <BR><BR>
Hospice	{}
Hospitallers	The <A href="bword://Knight">Knights</A> of the Order of the Hospital of St. John of Jerusalem, an order of knights formed after the capture of Jerusalem in 1099 recognized by the pope in 1113. The order provided hospitals and shelter for pilgrims on their way to the <A href="bword://Holy Lands">Holy Lands</A> , but they also fielded powerful military units of knights who fought in most every <A href="bword://Battle (bataille)">battle</A> of the <A href="bword://Crusade">Crusades</A> . When the Christians were driven from Jerusalem by Saladin, they reestablished their headquarters in <A href="bword://Acre">Acre</A> until that was lost in 1291. Consequently they built up a naval force and seized the island of Rhodes, which they took from the <A href="bword://Saracen">Saracens</A> in 1310. They formed an independent state on the site, building great wealth increased when Philip IV confiscated the estates of the <A href="bword://Templar, Knights (Knights of the Temple)">Templars</A> and turned many of them over to the order’s officers.
Houpelande	A garment common to the nobility during the very end of the 14th century and extending in various forms into the mid and late 15th century. It was characterized by long flowing sleeves, sometimes dagged in many interesting patterns. They were generally worn as court attire but a variety seems to have been adopted in place of the <A href="bword://surcoat">surcoat</A> , particularly in Germany during the late 14th century.
House of Commons	{}
House of Lords	The temporal and spiritual lords. Each lord was a <A href="bword://Peer">peer</A> of the realm who held their seats by hereditary right. During the 14th century the element of the <A href="bword://Magna Carta">Magna Carta</A> that granted the accused the right to trial by peers was interpreted to be only other peers within the House of Lords.
Household knights	The <A href="bword://Knight">knights</A> forming the entourage of a <A href="bword://Feudalism">feudal</A> <A href="bword://Lord">lord</A> , accompanying him to <A href="bword://Tournament (Tournoi)">tournament</A> and to war, paid first in food and housing, though later this was augmented with cash payments. By the late 14th century, the position was less one of a household knight and more one of staff officer, a military expert in the employ of a lord to assist him in the conduct of military and sometimes political affairs.
Humility	{}
Hundred	Subdivision of an English <A href="bword://Shire">shire</A> or a French county, each hundred had their own <A href="bword://Court">court</A> .
Hundred Years War	The war between England and France that lasted from the middle of the 14th century to the middle of the 15th century concerning the accession to the French throne and various holdings in France that had been under the control of the English crown. The techniques of warfare used, siege war, the <A href="bword://chevauchée">chevauchée</A> , and occasional set-piece battles were well recorded by Froissart and Engerrand de Monstrelet, two invaluable sources for study of the high middle ages.
Hundred Years War	The protracted conflict between England and France from 1337 to 1453. Edward III began the war in earnest when he assumed the title ‘king of France’ in 1337. The war was fought in stops and starts, with numerous truces and false instances of peace, during which there were many <a href="bword://Battle (bataille)">battles</A> fought. The tactics of <a href="bword://Chevauchée">chevauchée</A> and <a href="bword://Siege">siege</A> warfare were used<BR>with great effect. Early English victories at <a href="bword://Crècy, Battle of">Crècy</A> , <a href="bword://Poitiers, Battle of">Poitiers</A> and <a href="bword://Agincourt, Battle of">Agincourt</A> were gradually reversed until the last English holding<BR>on the continent, (except for <a href="bword://Calais">Calais</A>), fell in 1453.
Hundskul	See <A href="bword://Klappvisier">Klappvisier</A> . The pointed visor fitted to a <A href="bword://bascinet">bascinet</A> .
Indenture	A formal contract by which a high-ranking <A href="bword://Feudalism">feudal</A> <A href="bword://Lord">lord</A> , a <A href="bword://Prince">prince</A> or <A href="bword://King">king</A> , defined and retained the terms under which his <A href="bword://Liegeman">liegemen</A> would serve in a given campaign. Prior to the 14th century these agreements were basically verbal, but by the time of Edward III the contracts were often very specific. Contrast these documents with <A href="bword://Commissions of Array">commissions of array</A> , where the <A href="bword://Crown">Crown</A> levied a demand for troops on <A href="bword://Shire">shires</A> and <A href="bword://Borough">boroughs</A> .
Indirect Reduction	A process through which <a href="bword://steel">steel</A> is obtained from <a href="bword://iron">iron</A> ore, used in northern France at least as early as 1451. The hotter fire of a <a href="bword://stuckhofen">stuckhofen</A> would reduce the iron to a liquid, which could be collected on a bed of charcoal where a portion of the carbon would be oxidized and run off; the resulting material is steel. Also known as the Walloon method. See <a href="http://www.chronique.com/Chronique/chrniq13.htm">Chronique: The Journal of Chivalry #13</A> .
Indulgence	Granting forgiveness from sins, a profitable church service.
Infantry	A dismounted fighting man. During the bulk of the Middle Ages, the role of infantry was considered to be the role of the common man, a distinction is retains to a degree even in modern warfare. Generally, medieval infantry was more lightly armoured than the heavy <A href="bword://Cavalry">cavalry</A> that formed the heart of a medieval army. During the 14th century, the English experimented with the use of infantry and <A href="bword://Artillery">artillery</A> to great effect, defeating the cavalry-heavy armies of France and Spain and the massed <A href="bword://Spearmen">spearmen</A> of the Scots. Gradually, <A href="bword://Knight">knights</A> began to fight on foot as often as they fought mounted, but by this time the use of gunpowder changed the role of the knight and gave him the tactical role of officer rather than cavalryman.
Inns of Court	Four legal societies in London that control admission to the English bar. The inns derived their name from their 13th century founding, where the various masters of the law would gather and teach their apprentice lawyers, operating as a <A HREF="bword://guild">guild</A>.
Inquisition	<B>Interdict</B>: Religious censure, often used in the Middle Ages as a tool by the senior clergy to force a secular <A href="bword://Lord">lord’s</A> hand. Under the interdict, no religious services can be conducted, so no marriages, burials, or baptisms could be performed. Given the importance of religion to the people of the Middle Ages, the interdict was a powerful weapon, to a degree balancing the physical force available to the secular lords.
Insurance	See <a href="bword://Armour, as insurance">Armour, as insurance</A>
Interdict	Religious censure, often used in the Middle Ages as a tool by the senior clergy to force a secular <a href="bword://Lord">lord’s</A> hand. Under the interdict, no religious services can be conducted, so no marriages, burials, or baptisms could be performed. Given the importance of religion to the people of the Middle Ages, the interdict was a powerful weapon, to a degree balancing the physical force available to the secular lords.
Invocation	The ceremony used to start a <A HREF="bword://tournament">tournament</A> or <A href="bword://pas d'armes">pas d’armes</A> . There is little evidence for this being done in the Middle Ages, yet there is little evidence of any sort for what went on at these tourneys and festivals with regard to ceremony. The most accurate source we have is one that describes an ‘ideal’ tournament of the 15th century by King René d’Anjou, <A href="bword://Book on the Form and the Devising of a Tournament">The Book on the Form and the Devising of a Tournament</A> ; and there is no evidence to say that this is how tournaments were done--René himself says that this is an ideal rather than the reality. The sole references seem to be buried in Geoffrey de Charnay’s <B><I>Demands</B></I>; see Barber and Barker for more detailed information. It is clear that <A href="bword://Knight">knights</A> often swore an <A HREF="bword://oath">oath</A> at the start of a tournament. Charnay asks, ‘If a knight fails to swear such an oath, should he be excluded?’ <BR>Modern <A href="bword://Tournament Society">tournament companies</A> have taken this tradition from the <A HREF="bword://SCA">SCA</A> as a mechanism to set the tone and expectation for a day’s fighting, generally imploring the combatants to observe the rules, to value the striving more than hollow victory, and to set out what is expected of the combatant and <A HREF="bword://gallery">gallery</A> during the day’s fighting.
Iron, as a material for armour|Iron|Iron as a material for armour|material for armour	Surviving in a limited form after the fall of the Roman empire, until the 12th century the use of iron was restricted to weapons, <a href="bword://mail">mail</A> hauberks, and <a href="bword://casque">casques</A> or spangen helmets. During the 13th century sources for iron became more plentiful, and during the 14th century it became commonly available for use by armourers. <BR><BR>Recent tests by the Swiss Institute for Arms and Armour have shown that during the 15th century the use of <a href="bword://steel">steel</A> , iron strengthened by the addition of carbon, was mastered by both Italian and German craftsmen. After the middle of the century most armour was made from steel rather than iron, making it more durable, resistant to <a href="bword://rust">rust</A> , and more easily heat-treatable.
Item	The term usually used to specify a particular legal clause, commonly employed in <A href="bword://Tournaments, Rules for">tournament rules</A> and <A href="bword://Tournament declaration">declarations</A> . See also various examples of <A href="bword://Pas d’Armes">pas d’armes</A> <A href="bword://Challenge">challenges</A> to see how it is used, such as the 15th century Pas d’Armes in <A href="http://www.chronique.com/Chronique/chrindex.htm">Chronique: The Journal of Chivalry #16</A> .
Jambes	The part of a medieval saddle the was extended downwards to defend the legs. Using such defenses allowed jousters to avoid an additional <a href="bword://leg harness">leg harness</A> . They came into use during the 15th century and remained in use on jousting saddles throughout the 16th and 17th centuries.
Jarl	Welsh equivalent for <A href="bword://Earl">earl</A> or <A href="bword://Count">count</A> .
Jeu de la Hache	A 15th century treatise on axe-fighting, perhaps the most extensive <A href="bword://Fechtbuch">fechtbuch</A> known. It details the use of the halberd or <A href="bword://Poleaxe, pollaxe, polaxe">poleaxe</A> with great precision, including tactics useful in war, <A HREF="bword://tournament">tournament</A> , or even in <A href="bword://Judicial Duel">judicial duels</A> .

Joust of Peace	An <A href="bword://À plaisir">à plaisance</A> <A href="bword://Joust">joust</A> between two <A href="bword://Knight">knights</A> , usually done at <A href="bword://Tournament (Tournoi)">tournament</A> or between knights who want to test their <A href="bword://Prowess">prowess</A> against one another. Jousts, where individual knights demonstrated their prowess, grew in popularity from the 13th century onward; prior to that knights fought in tournaments primarily in groups. Frequently <A href="bword://Gallery">galleries</A> of ladies were present to watch jousts of peace, sometimes offering elaborate favors to the knights who championed their honor. During the late 15th and 16th centuries, specialized <A href="bword://Armour (Armor)">armour</A> that became very heavy was fashionable to use in the joust, great hulking pieces featuring many reinforcing <A href="bword://Plate">plates</A> and bolts, giving the <A href="bword://Harness">harnesses</A> a very alien appearance.
Joust of War	Very common during the <A href="bword://Hundred Years War">Hundred Years War</A> or at an <A href="bword://Emprise">emprise</A> , this was the same as a <A href="bword://Joust of Peace">joust of peace</A> except that the tips of the <A href="bword://Lance (weapon used in the joust)">lances</A> were sharpened rather than purposefully blunt. <A href="bword://Knight">Knights</A> were frequently killed or wounded in these engagements, and spectators other than other knights would have been uncommon.

Joyeuse	The famous <A href="bword://Sword">sword</A> of Charlemagne.
Joyeuse Guarde	The <A href="bword://Castle">castle</A> of Lancelot, held by popular legend to be Alnwick or Bamburg castles. Prior to the time when Lancelot came upon it, it was a cursed castle known as Dolorous Castle, but Lancelot was able to break the spell and take up residence within. When Arthur and Guenevere visited, the castle was renamed Joyeuse Guard, but after Lancelot’s adultery with Guenevere was discovered, the name reverted. It was to Dolorous Guard that they returned.
Judges	Officials in a <A href="bword://Tournament (Tournoi)">tournament</A> responsible for upholding the spirit and the rules determined by the sponsor. Charnay and King René both refer to the judges as diseurs.
Judicial Duel	Generally fought between combatants of <A href="bword://Knight">knightly</A> rank between the appellant and the defendant. A charge of dishonorable conduct underlies the combat, fought to the death before <A href="bword://Judges">judges</A> . Not a <A href="bword://Tournament (Tournoi)">tournament</A> , it is a form of trial by combat. Many of the surviving <A href="bword://Fechtbuch">fechtbuchs</A> seem to describe techniques used in the judicial duel that would have been forbidden in the tournament, such as piercing an opponent’s foot with the butt-spike of a <A href="bword://Poleaxe, pollaxe, polaxe">poleaxe</A> .

King	Crowned ruler of a territory or country called a <A href="bword://Kingdom, SCA">kingdom</A> . Derived from the German word konnen, ‘to be able’. <BR>Within the <A href="bword://Society for Creative Anachronism (SCA)">SCA</A> , the king is chosen in a <A href="bword://Crown Tournament">Crown Tournament</A> , generally a <A href="bword://Double-elimination lists">double-elimination list</A> . They accept the <A href="bword://Crown">Crown</A> from their predecessor at the <A href="bword://Coronation">coronation</A> ceremony, ruling over one of the more than thirteen SCA regions as administrative and executive head for six months. Each kingdom has from 1,000 - 3,000 people, so the job is a full-time one. At the end of the ‘<A href="bword://Reign">reign</A> ’, the <A href="bword://Nobility">noble</A> is accorded the rank of <A href="bword://Count">count</A> (1 reign) or <A href="bword://Duke">duke</A> (2+ reigns).
King of Arms	The <A href="bword://Heraldry and Heralds">herald</A> generally considered to be in charge of ceremony in both <A href="bword://Court">court</A> and in war. Heralds first arose as followers of the <A href="bword://Tournament (Tournoi)">tournament</A> , so it was a natural development that they grow into the role of ‘stage manager’ for the elaborate festivals and <A href="bword://Pas d'Armes">pas d’armes</A> that grew during the 15th and 16th centuries.

Kingdom,  SCA|Kingdom|SCA Kingdom	Within the <A href="bword://Society for Creative Anachronism (SCA)">Society for Creative Anachronism</A> , the administration and leadership of the territorial divisions are referred to as ‘kingdoms’, although SCA law states clearly that these divisions have no bearing on any mundane rule, law or authority. Each kingdom, geographically bound, has developed specific cultural practices that give each a unique identity. Each kingdom, ruled by a <A href="bword://King">king</A> and the greater officers of the kingdom (<A href="bword://Seneschal">Seneschal</A> , <A href="bword://Marshal">Marshal</A> , Exchequer, Chronicler) and their deputies, is broken down into further divisions--<A href="bword://Principality">principalities</A> , <A href="bword://Baron">baronys</A> , <A href="bword://Shire">shires</A> , colleges and marches.

Knight	The formal title of knight, the word deriving from the Anglo-Saxon Cniht, that described the office arising out of the<BR>warrior of the 11th century into a class of the lower <a href="bword://Nobility">nobility</A> charged with fighting for the <a href="bword://Liege">liege lord</A> and maintaining lordship over<BR>the demense, managing it and defending the people in exchange for <a href="bword://Scutage">scutage</A> from the property that supported him. Originally a<BR>purely martial description from the Latin <a href="bword://Milites">miles</A> , the definition of what it meant to be a knight changed as the influences of an<BR>increasingly formal <a href="bword://Court">court</A> and activist <a href="bword://Church and Knights">church</A> added expectations to the behavior of real knights. Throughout the medieval<BR>period, the role of the knight was changing, stretched between the conflicting demands of lady, court, church and battlefield.<BR>But the ideal of <a href="bword://Chivalry">chivalry</A> , the virtues to which a knight was to aspire, remain a powerful evocation of the best of Western culture,<BR>and this power remains today, giving strength to the modern <a href="bword://Tournament Society">tournament societies</A> and the knights who today strive to hone their<BR>martial skills and practice ethical conduct. See also <a href="http://www.chronique.com/Chronique/tbook.htm">THE BOOK OF THE TOURNAMENT</A> or <a href="http://www.chronique.com/Chronique/chrniq05.htm">Chronique: The Journal ofChivalry #5</A>.
Knight Errant	A <A href="bword://Knight">knight</A> who has gone to earn <A href="bword://Renown">renown</A> in wars, <A href="bword://Tournament (Tournoi)">tournaments</A> , <A href="bword://Joust">jousts</A> , or through adventures encountered in wandering travels. The knight errant was largely a figure of <A href="bword://Romances">romance</A> , but young knights in the middle ages did have a great need for such travels, since they stood to inherit nothing if they were a younger son. These knights formed themselves into small companies of knights who hired themselves out in wars or competed in tournaments to earn the <A href="bword://Ransom">ransoms</A> available for captured knights. Using their winnings and their reputations, they might be able to attract the attention of a lady or of a <A href="bword://Nobility">noble</A> <A href="bword://Lord">lord</A> and thus secure their future.
Knight, SCA|Knight|SCA Knight	The rank in the <A href="bword://Society for Creative Anachronism (SCA)">Society for Creative Anachronism</A> where those recognized are to have distinguished themselves in martial combat and possess the qualities expected of a <A href="bword://Nobility">nobleman</A> . Without doubt the rank of <A href="bword://Knighthood">knighthood</A> is an honor of the highest level for those who attain it, usually won after an average of three to ten years of martial experience and much growth in the character of the individual. It is often recognized not as an ending, but as the start of a lifelong journey for excellence, the recognition by the other knights in a <A href="bword://Kingdom, SCA">kingdom</A> that the individual has a good base from which to learn, grow, and teach. In most kingdoms, the knights meet and recommend candidates to the <A href="bword://King">king</A> , who listens to their counsel and makes the final decision as to who has attained the necessary support and <A href="bword://Renown">renown</A> to be accorded the accolade. It is then the king who performs the knighting, with great <A href="bword://Accolade">ceremony</A> , either at an SCA <A href="bword://Court">court</A> or upon the battlefield. It ranks equally with the <A href="bword://Laurel, Order of the">Order of the Laurel</A> and the <A href="bword://Pelican, Order of the">Order of the Pelican</A> , but below a <A href="bword://Baron">Baron</A> , <A href="bword://Viscount">Viscount</A> , or other higher nobility.
Knighthood	Being a <A href="bword://Knight">knight</A> . Knighthood was conferred in the <A href="bword://Adoubement">adoubement</A> ceremony, or the <A href="bword://Accolade">accolade</A> , at which time a young man or <A href="bword://Squire">squire</A> was formally adopted into the brotherhood of knights. Even though knights differed in their allegiance to <A href="bword://King">king</A> and <A href="bword://Kingdom, SCA">kingdom</A> , they often treated one another with a degree of respect uncommon in our age, when soldiers from opposing sides get little opportunity to make nose to nose contact with their opponents. Knighthood was a solemn office, but also an economic one, a defined social station that declined over time in favor of the economic might of the middle classes. The military role of knights metamorphasized into the officer, the values of virtues of knighthood becoming the description of a <A href="bword://Gentleman">gentleman</A> .

Laking, Sir Guy|Guy Laking|Sir Guy Laking	An early twentieth century scholar of arms and armour, whose book the Arms and Armour in Europe through Seven Centuries remains a cornerstone work in the field. <BR>
Lames	The term commonly applied to the plates added between major components to facilitate <a href="bword://articulation">articulation</A> . During the 14th century, this was generally accomplished with a maximum of three plates in the arm (two is better), and three in the leg. The vast majority of 14th century articulated <a href="bword://harness">harnesses</A> use only two plates, and the author's handling of two examples indicates that most harnesses probably did not allow for a full range of motion. In all probability, the motions allowed were what was required for the prevailing combat forms of the day, and the styles were in turn probably influenced by the armour technology available. Most lames were formed from very thin <a href="bword://iron">iron</A> plate, generally 18 or 20 or even 22 gage <a href="bword://steel">steel</A> . SCA lames are formed from 18 or 16 or even 14 gage steel, depending on the style of the armourer and the location to be defended. In my experience, <a href="bword://Hammer (armourer's tool)">hammer</A> -hardening lames helps to reduce the stress on the plate and gives it a resistance to tearing that helps a piece to endure. Additionally, most lames on the arms and the legs are rarely flat, as they are usually made in the SCA, but are rather slightly <a href="bword://dishing">dished</A> or <a href="bword://flaring">flared</A> . See also <a href="bword://Articulation">Articulation</A> , <a href="bword://Arm Harness">Arm Harness</A> , and <a href="bword://Leg Harness">Leg Harness</A> for more details.
Lance (unit organization)|Lance|unit organization	The small unit that surrounded a <A href="bword://Knight">knight</A> when we went into <A href="bword://Battle (bataille)">battle</A> during the 14th and 15th centuries. A lance might have consisted of one or two <A href="bword://Squire">squires</A> , the knight himself, one to three <A href="bword://Man-at-Arms">men-at-arms</A> , and possibly an <A href="bword://Archer">archer</A> . Lances were often combined under the <A href="bword://Banner">banner</A> of a higher ranking <A href="bword://Nobility">nobleman</A> to form companies of knights that would act as an ad-hoc unit.
Lance (weapon used in the joust)|Lance|weapon used in the joust	The long shaft of <a href="bword://ash">ash</A> tipped with a sharp <a href="bword://iron">iron</A> or <a href="bword://steel">steel</A> tip, varying in length from 9 to 14 feet in length. A vamplate was developed near the end of the 15th century to protect the hand and arm, and lance rests were built into <a href="bword://breastplate">breastplates</A> from the late 14th century onwards to help steady the lance as the horse galloped towards the target.
Largesse	An essential virtue of both <A href="bword://Knight">knights</A> and <A href="bword://Nobility">nobles</A> , best expressed by Chrètien de Troyes in his 12th century romance <A href="bword://Cligés">Cligès</A> :<BR><I>"'Dear son,' he said, 'believe me when I tell you that largesse is the queen and lady who brightens all virtues, and this is not difficult to prove. Where could one find a man who, no matter how powerful or rich, would not be reproached if he were miserly? What man has so many other good qualities--excepting only God's grace--that largesse would not increase his fame? Largesse alone makes one a worthy man, not high birth, courtesy, wisdom, gentility, riches, strength, chivalry, boldness, power, beauty, or any other gift. But just as the rose, when it buds fresh and new, is more beautiful than any other flower, so largesse, whenever it appears, surpasses all other virtues and causes the good qualities it finds in a worthy man who comports himself well to be increased five-hundred fold. There is so much to be said of largesse that I could not tell you the half."</I>
Latten	Brass, Bronze or a mixture of the two. Generally a copper base metal with elements of tin or zinc plus other trace elements. During the 14th century latten might well have been used for select armour bits, such as knuckle <a href="bword://gatlings">gatlings</A> , <a href="bword://couter">couters</A> , <a href="bword://poleyn">poleyns</A> , and for trim on armour during the latter part of the century. This trim might be further enhanced by <a href="bword://engraving">engraving</A> (especially Latin phrases from the bible or local mottoes) or by punchwork designed to emulate <a href="bword://rivets">rivet</A> heads.

Law of Arms	Unofficial, traditional rules of war arrived upon by mutual agreement. Never written down, the rules were the subject of much debate during the whole of the medieval period, governing the spoils of war in <A href="bword://Tournament (Tournoi)">tourney</A> and in war, <A href="bword://Ransom">ransoms</A> , <A href="bword://Safe-conduct">safe-conducts</A> , the treatment of prisoners, and the nature of just war. Edward III gave his <A href="bword://Court">courts</A> of <A href="bword://Chivalry">chivalry</A> exclusive right to rule over questions of such law, an interesting feat since the law was a matter of tradition rather than precedence as in common law. Honoret Bonet, in his 14th century treatise the <a href="bword://Tree of Battles">Tree of Battles</A>, was perhaps the first gentle to attempt to record these laws of war, or rather to clarify points of dispute that had risen up to that point. These ‘laws’ were the basis for most Western rules of warfare and even of international relations.

Leather, as a material during the 14th century|Leather|material during the 14th century	Before 1350, leather was a common material used to augment <a href="bword://mail">mail</A> defenses. The <a href="bword://vambrace">vambraces</A> , <a href="bword://cuisses">cuisses</A> , and <a href="bword://Greaves, shynbalds">greaves</A> were reinforced with leather that might have been something like modern sole leather, sometimes boiled or painted with beeswax <a href="bword://cuirboille">(cuirboille)</A> or sometimes simply shaped, and finished with something like lacquer. The chief piece of evidence are the <a href="bword://funerary brass">funerary brasses</A> of knights from the period, but these brasses do not help us to determine whether the defenses were gamboised (quilted), leather, or something else.
Leg Harness|Harness	Referring to all of the armour pieces defending the knight's leg, including the <a href="bword://cuisses">cuisse</A> (thigh), <a href="bword://poleyn">poleyn</A> (knee), <a href="bword://lames">lames</A> (connecting plates), and <a href="bword://Greaves, shynbalds">greave</A> or shynbald. During the 14th century the transition was made from the <a href="bword://mail">mail</A> defenses called chausses to the fully articulated leg harness, although the development was not even from place to place. By 1400 the fully leg harness had developed in the form that would survive until the 16th century. <BR><BR><I>Major Developments during the 14th century</I>:<BR>- 1300-1350 Chausses still used to <a href="bword://leg harness">defend the leg</A> , with the addition of plate or <a href="bword://leather">leather</A> <a href="bword://Greaves, shynbalds">shynbalds</A> to protect the calf. <BR>- 1320-1360 <a href="bword://Poleyn">Poleyns</A> are laced directly to the chausse, defending the knee. These poleyns appear to have extended around the knee and to have provided a <a href="bword://flaring">flared</A> lower edge to ease the transition to the <a href="bword://Greaves, shynbalds">shynbald</A> or chausses for the calf. <BR>- 1320-1340 <a href="bword://Poleyn">Poleyns</A> are occasionally reinforced with the addition of a small <a href="bword://rondel">rondel</A> to the side, additional protection for the back of the knee. <BR>- 1330-1375 The chausse is eliminated in some harnesses in place of a plate <a href="bword://cuisses">cuisse</A> that defends the thigh. By 1375 this plate was made in a single piece and articulated with the <a href="bword://poleyn">poleyn</A> through the use of two or three <a href="bword://lames">lames</A> (only one lame is used to <a href="bword://articulation">articulate</A> the cuisse to the poleyn; two lames are sometimes used for the demi-<a href="bword://Greaves, shynbalds">greave</A> attachment). <BR>- 1340-1400 Instead of a <a href="bword://rondel">rondel</A> attached by a central <a href="bword://rivets">rivet</A> , the <a href="bword://poleyn">poleyn</A> itself is extended to form a <a href="bword://wing">&quotwing"</A> on the side of the knee cop, usually some variant on the heart shape.

Liegeman	A sworn <A href="bword://Vassal">vassal</A> who has commited himself to the homage of his <A href="bword://Liege">liege</A> lord, generally a military and political alliance.
List	The place where a <A href="bword://Tournament (Tournoi)">tournament</A> was to be held. &quotTo be in the lists" meant to be competing in the tournament, as well as referring to the physical place where the combats were held. Originally the lists were simply designated as participation, but by the 14th century, when more enclosed fields began to be used, the term meant the field. During the 15th century René d’Anjou described the lists in great detail, including the proper dimensions for the field. <BR>In modern usage the word has been twisted somewhat to mean the list of combatants who are participating in a tournament. In the <A href="bword://Company of Saint George">Company of Saint George</A> we have used the term &quotlist enclosure" to refer to our fencing that surrounds a list field, "<A href="bword://Venans">venans</A> " to refer to the challengers and "<A href="bword://Tenans">tenans</A> " to refer to the defenders, sometimes the sponsors of a <A href="bword://Pas d'Armes">pas d’armes</A> .

Longbow	The weapon of the <a href="bword://archer">archer</A> , used for launching arrows, developed in Europe. Compare it with the shorter composite bow of the Saracen, which had a shorter draw but was easier to use from horseback. Longbows were the preferred weapon of the English after the middle 14th century, Edward III recognizing the power of massed artillery (archers) used in combination with dismounted cavalry and infantry. The longbow, with a draw from 30 - 36", could launch an arrow more than 300 yards, deadly against opponents not defended by <a href="bword://plate">plate</A> armour.

mace	A short mass weapon not unlike a heavy club. After the third quarter of the 14th century the club end was often made of metal and enhanced with metal flanges or spikes.
Magna Carta	The agreement forced upon King John by the English <A href="bword://Baron">barons</A> on June 15, 1215, at Runnymede, England, that stripped many powers from the <A href="bword://King">king</A> in favor of the barons. The barons created a group of 25 of their number, the forerunner of the first English parliament founded fifty years later. The innovation in the charter was that one of the baron’s number could make a complaint to at least four of the twenty five, who would then determine of their complaint against the king was valid. If it was found to be so, then the king had forty days to correct the ‘injustice’, after which the barons would seize such property of His Majesty and the Royal family as deemed necessary for redress. The charter layed the foundation for the first constitutional monarchy wherein the king’s heretofore legally limitless powers were formally checked by another political body. In ordinary <A href="bword://Feudal System">feudal systems</A> , the power of the king was checked not by a formal political mechanism but by the power of the great Royal <A href="bword://Peer">Peers</A> , whose support in political and military affairs he required to maintain authority and legitimacy.<BR>- <A href="http://www.chronique.com/Library/MedHistory/magna.htm">Complete Text</A>

Mail	Interwoven links of <A href="bword://iron">iron</A> wire riveted together to form a kind of defensive metal cloth, highly resistant to slashing but less effective against piercing or crushing wounds. During the latter 14th and 15th centuries sometimes the riveted links were interposed with solid links that had been stamped to halve the production time. Mail was made by specialized <A href="bword://armourer">armourers</A> , and because it was easy to make, seems to have been manufactured all over Europe, first introduced by the Romans during the latter days of their empire.

Manor	The granting of land with a demense, peasants and lands considered requisite to sustain a minor noble. The demense was the lord’s personal land, providing for their needs, while the land worked by the peasants provided additional income or food consumed by the lord or his retainers.
Mantling	The cloth decor suspended from a helmet, commonly illustrated in armorial artwork. The most splendid references to mantling are to be found in King René's Livre Tournoi, where they are shown matching or enhancing the heraldic colors worn by tournament combatants. See <A href="http://www.chronique.com/Chronique/chrniq10/htm">Chronique: The Journal of Chivalry #10</A> .
Marshal	Officer of the <A href="bword://King">king’s</A> household, the officer in charge of horses and other animals for sport--the mews, hounds, and frequently the guards or <A href="bword://Archer">archers</A> . In times of war there were other military duties associated with the office, the office was originally the keeper of the royal stables but gradually evolved into a high military office. The highest marshal in England, originally known as the Great Marshal of England, was customarily known as the earl Marshal, not because that was the title of the office, but because the holder was generally an <A href="bword://Earl">earl</A> . The marshal, ranking just under the <A href="bword://Constable">constable</A> , served with him in English <A href="bword://Court">courts</A> of <A href="bword://Chivalry">chivalry</A> , after Edward III established the court as a formal body. <BR>Within the <A href="bword://Society for Creative Anachronism (SCA)">SCA</A> , the marshals are responsible for the safety of the <A href="bword://List">lists</A> .

Maximillian	Armour created at the beginning of the 16th century for the Emperor Maximillian, characterized by <A href="bword://armet">armets</A> and close helmets with bellows <A href="bword://visor">visors</A> ; small fan-shaped <A href="bword://fluting">fluting</A> often covering most of the <A href="bword://harness">harness</A> (but never the <A href="bword://Greaves, shynbalds">greaves</A> ); <A href="bword://etching">etching</A> , work taken from woodcuts; sharply waisted <A href="bword://cuirass">cuirasses</A> and squared <A href="bword://sabaton">sabatons</A> .
Mazzacudo	An interesting form of Italian foot <A href="bword://Tournament (Tournoi)">tournament</A> from the 14th century where the participants used a club and <A href="bword://Shield (construction of)">shield</A> . The accounts from Pisa tell of a square in the city where men could go at any time between Christmas to Shrove Tuesday and challenge whomever they liked. The whole affair, conducted in the wintertime, climaxed in the holidays, when a large crowd gathered to watch the proceedings. Individuals would paint images their lovers on their shields, fighting in their <A href="bword://Honor">honor</A> . Trumpets sounded the start of the general <A href="bword://mêlée">mêlée</A> .

Milanese	The descriptive term for Italian armour of the 15th century characterized by an organic, rounded line. Milanese armours are generally made from larger plates than their German <A href="bword://gothic armour">gothic</A> counterparts, have little <A href="bword://fluting">fluting</A> , and are more curvaceous. Milan and Venice were the major armour production centers in Italy, home to the famous <A href="bword://Missiglia">Missiglian</A> family. The <A href="bword://barbute">barbute</A> and <A href="bword://armet">armet</A> were two innovations of this style; the barbute died out but the armet evolved into the close helmet during the early years of the 16th century.
Military belt|belt	References to the military belt go all the way back to the Germanic tribes described by Tacitus in the 5th century. The military best seems to have been the predominant symbol of the military man for the whole medieval period. During the 14th century it took the form of a metal belt, sometimes white, with metal plates or <A href="http://www.chronique.com/Library/Glossaries/glossary-AA/arms_p.htm#plaque belt">plaques</A> . The belt was given to a knight at the adoubement ceremony, usually by a respected knight or one who has close ties to the candidate, or occasionally, especially in the case of mass battlefield knightings, by a king or prince.
Milites	(Singular miles) The Latin term for &quotmen at arms," or &quotsoldier" used to cover what later became known as "<A href="bword://Knight">knights</A> " in English, &quotChevaliers" in French, &quotCaballero" in Spanish, and &quotRitter" in German. It seems to have come into use during the 10th century, before there was any attachment of the &quotknightly virtues" or the term "<A href="bword://Chivalry">chivalry</A> ," which came into use in France during the 12th century. By the end of the 12th century these warriors had evolved into their own social class, a caste in society, gradually becoming attached to the lower <A href="bword://Nobility">nobility</A> .

Missiglia,  armourer family|Missiglia|armourer family	Active in Milan from the middle of the 14th century until the end of the 16th , the Missiglian family mark was known for quality and expense. The family changed their name during the 16th century and became the Negroli, but I am not sure how or why this came about.
Mitten Gauntlet	A defense for the hand that seems to have originated in Italy during the early 15th century. Early mittens were formed from three main plates, one forming the <A href="bword://metacarpal">metacarpal</A> and the <A href="bword://cuff">cuff</A> (this was sometimes split into two plates joined at the wrist), and two plates articulated carefully together to provide a defense for the fingers. Scale pieces were added to the thumb as well. During the 16th century the mitten idea was used alongside of finger gauntlets in a more international style spun from a mixture of <A href="bword://Milanese">Milanese</A> and <A href="bword://gothic armour">gothic</A> elements.
Moat, Mote|Moat|Mote	The ditch surrounding a <A HREF="http://www.chronique.com/Library/Glossaries/glossary-KCT/gloss_c.htm#castle">castle</A> or fortification, generally filled with water, to deter besieging forces from access to the walls.

Morte d’Arthur	The misnamed printed version of Sir Thomas Malory’s <B><I>The Whole Book of King Arthur and of His Noble Knights of the Round Table</B></I>, completed between 1469-70. Caxton issued his printed version in 1485, part of his effort to re-establish <A href="bword://Romances">romantic</A> literature as a method to improve the quality of the <A href="bword://Knight">knights</A> in England, who he dispaired had become degenerate and ill-equipped for war. The Morte d’Arthur is a massive work, originally divided into 21 books of 507 chapters, it covers the entire history of Arthur and each of his knights, stories compiled from the rich corpus of Arthurian literature in French and English.
Moslem,  Muslim|Moslem|Muslim	The proper name for a follower of the Islamic faith (founded c. 600 A.D.), known to most medieval people as <A href="bword://Saracen">Saracens</A> .

Mottoes were adopted purely at the pleasure of the individual, there was no prerequisite and no registering authority. Mottoes were traditionally not hereditary; each individual crafted their own.
Munitions Armour	Armour mass-produced for the common foot-soldier, increasingly available during the 15th, 16th and 17th centuries. Frequently this armour was sold 'rough from the hammer' without <A href="bword://Polish, finish appropriate for the 14th century">polishing</A> , still featuring the hammermarks of the final <A href="bword://planishing">planishing</A> , accomplished to smooth out the surface of the metal and to provide for <A href="bword://Hammer (armourer's tool)">hammer</A> -hardening.
Murder-hole	A hole cut in the roof of passages needing defense, such as in gatehouses or along the top of curtain walls. Through murder holes could be poured hot water, oil, stones or <A href="bword://Archer">archers</A> could fire through them wrecking havoc on the assaulting troops.

Musée de l'Armée, Hôtel National des Invalides, 51, Bd. La Tour Maubourg, 75007 PARIS, Tel: 44 42 37 67.
Mêlée|Melee	A group combat or ‘free for all’ where teams or groups of individuals met in the field. A mecirc;l&eacutee can describe any group combat. When applied to <A href="bword://Tournament (Tournoi)">tournaments</A> , it takes on the connotation of a group encounter where generally two groups competed against one another.
Nail Money	Money paid to a <a href="bword://Heraldry and Heralds">herald</A> for services at the <a href="bword://Tournament (Tournoi)">tournament</A> , derived from the heraldic duty of nailing the knight’s <a href="bword://Shield (construction of)">shield</A> to the tree of challenges.
Neck, defense of|Neck|defense of Neck	During the 13th century, the neck was defended by a coif worn under the helmet. With the development of the <a href="bword://Bascinet">bascinet</A> during the 14th century, most knights wore <a href="bword://Aventail">aventails</A> suspended from the helmet. <a href="bword://Great bascinet">Great bascinets</A> replaced this aventail with a <a href="bword://Gorge, gorget, collar">plate collar</A> , also attached to the bascinet itself, then fastened to the <a href="bword://Cuirass">cuirass</A> . 15th century helmets used both aventails (on <a href="bword://Armet (à rondel)">armets</A> ) and <a href="bword://Bevor, buff, bevier">bevors</A> to defend the throat. 16th century helmets usually used a combination of chin defenses and a <a href="bword://Gorge, gorget, collar">gorget</A> that defended the lower portion of the throat. <BR>
Nine Worthies	The nine figures of ‘history’, known for their particular qualities of <a href="bword://Prowess">prowess</A> and <a href="bword://Chivalry">chivalry</A>. The first iteration of<BR>the Worthies occurs in the 14th century, when the list comprised the following: <BR><BR>Hector, Ceasar, Alexander <BR>Arthur, Charlemagne, Godfrey de Bouillon <BR>Joshua, David, Judas Maccabeus <BR><BR>Later, French authors added a 10th worthy, Bertrand du Guesclin, but this addition did not take hold outside of France. The<BR>worthies were a very popular shorthand for a sort of chivalric ‘hall of fame’, an inspiration for poetry, romance, stained glass<BR>windows, sculpture, tapestries and woodcuts.
Nobility	This meant literally descent from a noble or aristocratic family. Despite this, there was an ongoing debate during the<BR>Middle Ages on whether man was ennobled by his actions or by his heritage, something similar to our own ‘nature vs nurture’<BR>debate.

Oath	Invocation of a supernatural or holy being called to verify the veracity of a statement. Sometimes, oaths were given over a <A href="bword://relic">relic</A> or a church altar. An oath was a special appeal, an expression of sincerity backed up by the threat of divine retribution should the uttering prove false--hence the term ‘oath-breaker’. An oathbreaker was assumed to have committed a crime against God or of some divine entity, which would lead to damnation or another form of severe penalty. Such oaths might take the form of ‘I swear upon the all that is Right and Holy that...’ Or, placing one’s hand upon a holy relic, ‘I, Reginald, do swear before these gathered witnesses that I did see...’
Oath of Fealty	The specific oath given to a <A href="bword://Liege">liege lord</A> , swearing to execute the duties of the <A href="bword://Feudalism">feudal</A> contract between the <A href="bword://Lord">lord</A> and his <A href="bword://Vassal">vassal</A> .

Of Four Quarterings|Four Quarterings	<A href="bword://Nobility">Noble</A> heritage from all four grandparents. The concept of nobility came in most medieval senses not from a nobility of character, though that was certainly sought, but from a nobility in the blood. It was strongly believed that much of a person’s character derived from their ‘blood’, their heritage. During the 13th century, <A href="bword://Tournament (Tournoi)">tournaments</A> began to require that <A href="bword://Knight">knights</A> prove noble descent from all four lines to be considered noble enough to participate.

Painting (armour)|Painting|armour Painting	From the 13th century onward, painting seems to be a common method of protecting armour from the elements. Very common during the 13th, 14th and 15th centuries, less so after that, although the black-and-silver armour style of the 16th century used painted black surfaces contrasted with <A href="http://www.chronique.com/Library/Glossaries/glossary-AA/arms_p.htm#polish, 14th century">polished</A> metal surfaces to achieve striking effects.

Essentially a group of challenges, the pas generally produced no single winner, but the defenders often distributed <A href="bword://Prize Tournament">prizes</A> to the challengers. Contrast this with an <A href="bword://Emprise">emprise</A> where the intent was to cause harm and emphasize prowess alone.

Pas Noire	A modern <A href="bword://Society for Creative Anachronism (SCA)">SCA</A> <A href="bword://Tournament (Tournoi)">tournament</A> format, where combatants fight at night, surrounded by a field lit only by torches. Generally the <A href="bword://Gallery">gallery</A> for these events is active and boisterous; drumming generally accompanies the raucous fighting. The pas noire, more commonly known as a ‘torchlight tourney’, shares come common elements with the <A href="bword://Pas d’Armes">pas d’armes</A> , but has a decidedly darker tone.
Pauldron	The larger defense of the shoulder where one or more large plates extended the defense of the shoulder to include the underarm and part of the chest and back. First used in an inventory C. 1397, there are no other references prior to 1450, though modern students apply the term to any shoulder defense where the coverage extends beyond the arm-hole of the <A href="bword://cuirass">cuirass</A> . Almost always made in <A href="bword://iron">iron</A> , and very rarely adorned except for the <A href="bword://fluting">fluting</A> in some later German examples.

Peer	Generally a class-descriptive term applied to those of <A href="bword://Baron">baronial House of Lords</A> . Over time, the word has come to describe the members of the ‘greater <A href="bword://Nobility">nobility</A> ’ who ruled over the general <A href="bword://Knight">knightly</A> classes.
Peerage	The group of <A href="bword://Nobility">nobles</A> , <A href="bword://Baron">barons</A> and above, considered to be peers. In an <A href="bword://Society for Creative Anachronism (SCA)">SCA</A> context, the peers are comprised of the three equal branches, the <A href="bword://Laurel, Order of the">Laurel</A> , <A href="bword://Pelican, Order of the">Pelican</A> and <A href="bword://Knight">Knight</A> . The three orders are in taken to be equal, though not the same--companions of the order of the Laurel are known for their excellence in the arts, the Pelican for their service to the kingdom, and the knights for their <A href="bword://Prowess">prowess</A> on the field.

Pien	To secure a <A href="bword://rivets">rivet</A> into place by <A href="bword://Hammer (armourer's tool)">hammering</A> . A mushroom of the rivet material is formed and the materials to be joined trapped in between the rivet head and the mushroom. A round face is used to make the shape, and sometimes if a soft material is to be secured to a hard one (such as a <A href="bword://leather">leather</A> strap to a piece of armour) then a rough washer might be cut and placed under the mushroom side of the rivet.
Piety	Just as faith was an important medieval virtue of particular importance to <A href="bword://Knight">knights</A> , piety kept that faith strongly held.
Pignose	The modern name to describe a pointed <A href="bword://bascinet">bascinet</A> <A href="bword://visor">visor</A> , popular during the second and third quarter of the 14th century. The proper name is the hunskull.
Pike	The long <A href="bword://spear">spear</A> , with a small <A href="bword://steel">steel</A> head. Up to 20 feet in length, they were popular with the Scots, Swiss and Flemings during the 14th, 15th, and 16th centuries. The use of compacted pikemen was a powerful counter to cavalry, but was usually checked with arrows or missile fire.
Pikemen	See <A href="bword://Spearmen">Spearmen</A> .
Planishing	The final <A href="bword://Hammer (armourer's tool)">hammer</A> work done on a piece. Anywhere from 1000-10000 hammer strokes are required to provide a smooth, even layer of faceted hammer marks ready for sanding and <A href="http://www.chronique.com/Library/Glossaries/glossary-AA/arms_p.htm#polish, 14th century">polishing</A> . Additionally, if the piece is not to be heat-treated, then a complete planishing lends a good hammer-hardening to the piece, helping it to resist deforming under the stress of combat. See also <A href="http://www.chronique.com/Chronique/chrniq06.htm">Chronique: The Journal of Chivalry #6</A> .
Plaque belt	A <A href="bword://military belt">military belt</A> formed from interlocking metal plates or featuring metal plates <A href="bword://rivets">riveted</A> to a <A href="bword://leather">leather</A> base. Common in the <A href="bword://funerary brass">funerary brasses</A> , very few real examples remain. They were generally formed from cast bronze, brass or <A href="bword://latten">latten</A> , usually thick enough to give some value to the casting. Modern <A href="bword://armourer">armourers</A> have begun to make plaque belts for consumption by the tournament societies.
Plate	A general term for iron defenses fashioned from sheet <A href="bword://iron">iron</A> or <A href="bword://steel">steel</A> . &quotPlate" defenses were during the Middle Ages first introduced during the late 13th century, first as reinforcing for <A href="bword://mail">mail</A> defenses and later as defenses on their own. During the 15th century full 'plate' armour had evolved from <A href="bword://Cap à pied">'cap a pied'</A> , from head to toe, weighing approximately 50 lbs--enough to protect the knight but light enough to allow quick movement on the battlefield. Note that the pack carried by a modern infantryman weighs approximately the same as a suit of medieval armour.
Poitiers, Battle of|Battle of Poitiers	The landmark <A href="bword://Battle (bataille)">battle</A> of the <A href="bword://Hundred Years War">Hundred Years War</A> between John II, king of France, and Edward the Black Prince, in 1356, during which the French tried to smash the English lines with a <A href="bword://Cavalry">cavalry</A> charge, but were repelled by a massive missile attack that destroyed the cavalry. Successive French units trampled those in front, those in the back pressing forward at the sound of the engagement. The French were unable to rally, fragmenting to the point where the <A href="bword://Oriflamme">Oriflamme</A> , carried by Geoffrey de Charnay, was unfurled. The Sieur de Charnay was slain defending the <A href="bword://Banner">banner</A> and the French <A href="bword://King">king</A> taken prisoner. See also <A href="http://www.chronique.com/Chronique/chrniq03.htm">Chronique: The Journal of Chivalry #3</A> .
Polearm	The general term for a group of pole-mounted weapons usually featuring a cutting or slashing weapon on one end. The halberd, guisarm, bill, bec-de-corbin, and poleaxe are all specific kinds of polearms, rising in popularity during the 15th century and into the 16th amongst the infantry.
Poleaxe, pollaxe,  polaxe|Poleaxe|polaxe|pollaxe	&quotA knightly staff weapon, its head being an axehead, usually balanced by a hammerhead, and surmounted by a <A href="bword://steel">steel</A> spike. The shaft was protected by steel checks and the hand by a steel <A href="bword://rondel">rondel</A> . Used from the fifteenth century for foot combats and for war. The component 'pole' in the name refers not to the staff, but to the Old English word 'head.'"-David Edge and John Miles Paddock, Arms and Armour of the Medieval Knight.
Poleyn	The period name for what is known in modern SCA verbiage as the &quotknee cop," the defense of the knee. During the early 14th century, <A href="bword://rondel">rondels</A> were laced to the <A href="bword://mail">mail</A> to improve the defense of the leg and add to the defense offered by a mail chausse. By 1320 these rondels had been replaced by a fully-encompassing &quotgutter" around the knee itself, laced into place or attached to a <A href="bword://leather">leather</A> or gamboised or <A href="bword://splinted defense">splinted</A> <A href="bword://cuisses">cuisse</A> at the top and the same construction of <A href="bword://Greaves, shynbalds">greave</A> to the bottom. By 1350 the poleyn was <A href="bword://articulation">articulated</A> with <A href="bword://lames">lames</A> ; a heart-shaped <A href="bword://wing">wing</A> was then extended from the poleyn itself to provide more protection for the back of the knee. After this point the poleyn decreased steadily in size, providing for a better platform for the articulation of the joint. This wing expanded and, with minor variations, remained reasonably constant in shape (though larger) throughout the 15th century. 14th century poleyns were generally articulated with no more than three lames, one on top and one or two between the demi-greave and poleyn itself. See also <A href="bword://leg harness">leg harness</A> .
Polish,  finish appropriate for the 14th century|Polish|finish appropriate for the 14th century	We have only a few examples of how armour was finished during this period. Generally, it appears as a satin brushed finish, something you might achieve with thousand-grit sandpaper. Other sources speak of highly polished armour, &quotthat glints in the sun." Still other armour was <A href="bword://painting (armour)">painted</A> . The reason for this polish is that it resists <A href="bword://rust">rust</A> , and that it imparts a glory to the pieces rarely seen in the modern world. It evokes the image of the &quotknight in shining armour," connecting the combatant with the romantic history that feeds tournament reenactments. <BR>To achieve this finish now, a belt sander with a 2" x 72" belt is the best thing I have seen, followed with a polishing wheel of 80 grit to a high stainless polish.
Polish, maintaining (modern)|Polish|Polish maintaining|modern Polish maintaining	We have found that the absolutely best thing is a microcrystalline wax, sold to museums and to furniture restorers as Renaissance Wax. Happich Simichrome is useful for removing light <a href="bword://rust">rust</A> and cleaning the metal prior to the waxing (motorcycle shops often have it). Keep all pieces separated in their own bags (pillowcases work well), since scratching wears pieces more definitely than does moisture. Lastly, polish from time to time bringing the polish back up to a high gloss using a buffing wheel and greaseless compound. <BR>
Polish, maintaining (period)|Polish|Polish maintaining|Polish maintaining period|period Polish maintaining	Most period armour was maintained by squires or grooms who would go over the surfaces with a brush. More extensive work was probably done at a guildhall, where waterwheels could be used and coated with fine sand to act as sandpaper. Similar wheels covered in <a href="bword://leather">leather</A> and painted with various compounds could easily polish armour in the same way that we can do now, but at a much slower pace.<a href="bword://Mail">Mail</A> was often placed into drums and dragged or turned, tumbling it with sand and vinegar to remove the rust. I can find no authentic references to the use of wax or oil in the care of pieces.<BR>
Pommel	The end of a <A href="bword://sword">sword's</A> hilt, a counterweight, frequently in the shape of an almond, 'wheel' or faceted element. Normally pommels were made from <A href="bword://iron">iron</A> , left plain or adorned with washed gold, silver, enamels, or precious stones. Sometimes they were made from <A href="bword://latten">latten</A> , and in a few instances they were even made from semi-precious stones. The pommel is an important element in the balance of a *sword, providing the right amount of counterweight to allow the blade to move easily in the wielder's hand.
Pook	A modern technical armouring term and inside joke. Seriously, it is a descriptive term that tries to evoke a picture of pulling metal out in a particular way or pressing it inwards. I have found this term used by many <A href="bword://armourer">armourers</A> around the USA, armourers who have little contact with one another but who have found this term flexible and useful.
Portcullis	A heavy wooden or metal gate that closed an entrance to a <A href="bword://Castle">castle</A> . Portcullises were generally controlled from an interior room on the gatehouse, raising and lowering it as required.
Pourpoint	literally &quotfor points," an arming garment worn under or as an <A href="bword://aketon">aketon</A> in order to lace on the other armour bits. See also <A href="http://www.chronique.com/Chronique/chrniq02.htm">Chronique: The Journal of Chivalry #2</A> .
Preux	<A href="bword://Prowess">Prowess courage</A> and success. To be considered ‘preudomme’, a man of prowess, was considered to be one of the highest compliments possible for a medieval <A href="bword://Knight">knight</A> . ‘Soix Preux!’ was frequently the admonition given to new knights as they were to go out and earn <A href="bword://Renown">renown</A> in the wake of their new knighthood.
Pride	Often a disputed ‘virtue’, pride is another motivator for men in general, valued by <A href="bword://Knight">knights</A> in some measure, but frequently preached against by the <A href="bword://Church and Knights">church</A> . I believe that a distinction can be plainly seen between pride, the quality of valuing quality performance, and vainglory, the elevation of pride to a more important component of the ego.
Prince	A ruler, from the latin princeps, meaning first in rank. In general, any ruler came to be known as the ‘prince’, the ‘ruler’, as in Machievelli’s Prince. Also a male heir in a Royal household, the ‘Crown’ prince was the first in line to the throne. <BR>In an <A href="bword://Society for Creative Anachronism (SCA)">SCA</A> context, a prince rules a <A href="bword://Principality">principality</A> , a <A href="bword://Kingdom, SCA">kingdom</A> subdivision.

Prize Tournament	An <A href="bword://Society for Creative Anachronism (SCA)">SCA</A> <A href="bword://Tournament (Tournoi)">tournament</A> where the winner is chosen by a tally of points or from the outcome of a successive round elimination tournament, known sometimes as ‘<A href="bword://Single-elimination lists">single-</A> ’ or ‘<A href="bword://Double-elimination lists">double-elimination</A> tournaments. The most prestigious prize tournaments are the <A href="bword://Crown Tournament">Crown tournaments</A> , where combatants meet, generally in double-elimination lists, to determine who will <A href="bword://Reign">reign</A> over the <A href="bword://Kingdom, SCA">kingdom</A> as <A href="bword://King">king</A> for the next period of time. There is some dispute as to whether this style of tournament is the best mechanism for selection of a monarch, primarily owing to the temptation of combatants to ‘cheat’ the gray area of blow calibration and thus advance towards the throne or prize at the expense of the other combatants.
Prizes in tournament	{}
Prowess	Physical ability for <A href="bword://Knight">knightly</A> sports including strength, speed, dexterity, training, tactical ability, cunning. In short, martial excellence. Prowess is the basic virtue shared by all martial societies, whether it be excellence in swordsmanship, horsemanship, or in the modern day, movement and marksmanship. Early on these warrior virtues were augmented by additional virtues suggested by the <A href="bword://Romances">romances</A> and the <A href="bword://Church and Knights">church</A> , yielding a more rounded gentleman. As late as the Renaissance, Christine de Pisan and Baldassare Castiglione still counted Prowess as an important quality for the courtier.
Pursuivant	A <A href="bword://Heraldry and Heralds">herald</A> . (more to be added)
Questing Beast	{}
Quintain	A target attached to a pole, often rotating, used to teach accuracy in jousting. A poor hit often spun the pole to buffet the attacker.
Raising (raised)|Raising|raised	The art of compressing the metal to form the desired shape. Raised work is done from the outside, over stakes, rather than from the inside. Raised pieces are very easy to keep symmetrical, have a strength not common to domed, <a href="bword://Dishing">dished</A> and welded pieces, and are far more difficult to create. See books on silversmithing for the best instruction (but you'll need to anneal the metal differently and use much heavier <a href="bword://Hammer (armourer's tool)">hammers</A>). <BR>
Ramparts	A broad earthwork around a fortification upon which walls or <A href="bword://Parapet">parapets</A> were built.
Ransom	The idea that a <A href="bword://Knight">knight</A> would be captured rather than killed if defeated. In war, this generally meant the payment of a large capital sum, while in <A href="bword://Tournament (Tournoi)">tourney</A> it often meant forfeiture of armour and horse. See also <A href="bword://Armour, as insurance">Armour, as insurance</A> .
Ransom Tournament	A modern format of <A href="bword://Tournament (Tournoi)">tournament</A> growing in popularity in the <A href="bword://Society for Creative Anachronism (SCA)">Society for Creative Anachronism</A> , frequently called William Marshal tournaments after the greatest tourneyer of the ransom-tourney age. In these tournaments men entered the <A href="bword://List">lists</A> at their own risk--if they were ‘defeated’ their horse and armour was forfeit to the capturing <A href="bword://Knight">knight</A> . This was a popular way for younger sons of knights and <A href="bword://nobility">nobles</A> to earn a living and to earn <A href="bword://Renown">renown</A> . In the SCA form of the tourney, combatants enter the lists worth a certain number of tokens or coins or a point value ranking according to their rank within the Society. If they are ‘killed’, they must accompany their captor without hindrance to their <A href="bword://Recess">recess</A> , where they must surrender their <A href="bword://Ransom">ransom</A> or tally their point value to the captor’s total. These tourneys have proven to be excellent fund-raisers; the <A href="bword://Company of Saint George">Company of Saint George</A> first tried such a tourney as a fund-raiser for the kingdom newsletter, the Page, and the Company of the Angels held another such tourney two years later, donating their proceeds to the Tomb of William Marshal in London.

Relic	A holy object or portion of a holy object that maintained a mystical connection with the holy. There were many false relics pawned during the Middle Ages, forgeries no different from the art fakes now sold. Relics were often used to swear upon, perhaps the bones of a saint, a portion of the True Cross, or some such was touched in the impromptu ceremony of an oath. Relics were also incorporated into other objects with the hope that the connection with the holy would transmit something of that holy character to the larger artifact. <A href="bword://Sword">Swords</A> sometimes worked relics into the <A href="bword://Pommel">pommels</A> and in churches, altars were contained some object thought to be a relic.
Renown	The reputation of a combatant based upon the virtues that others perceive in him from his word, thoughts and deeds. See also the essay concerning <A href="http://www.chronique.com/CSG/errants.htm">Errants the Company of Saint George</A> . I have called renown the ‘coin of the tourneyer’, the only thing a combatant takes to the field, and the only thing he takes home from it.
René-style Tournament|Rene-style Tournament	In the context of the <A href="bword://Society for Creative Anachronism (SCA)">SCA</A> , several groups have attempted to stage <A href="bword://Tournament (Tournoi)">tournaments</A> in the tradition of King René d’Anjou as detailed in his <A href="bword://Book of the Tournament">tournament book</A> .

Richard I’s Tournament Decree (1194)|Richard I’s Tournament Decree	Richard licensed five places in England where <A href="bword://Tournament (Tournoi)">tournaments</A> could be held: Between Salisbury and Wilton, Warwick and Kenilworth, Stamford and Warinford, Brackley and Mixbury, and Blyth and Tickhill. Those who wished to tourney there had to obtain a license and issue payment for the privilege, and foreign <A href="bword://Knight">knights</A> were prohibited from tourneying in England. This is perhaps the first secular regulation of a tournament, done for the dual purpose of encouraging the sport and reducing the potential for it to be used as a gathering point for disloyal opposition.<BR><I>&quotThe famous king Richard, observing that the extra training and instruction of the French has made them correspondingly fierce in war, wished that the knights of his kingdom should train in their own lands, so that they could learn from tourneying the art of war and so that the French could not insult the English knights for being crude and less skilled."</I>

Romances	Works written concerning <A href="bword://Knight">knights</A> and <A href="bword://Chivalry">chivalry</A> , originating during the 12th century, expanding to England, Spain, Italy and Germany. The works originally were built by the Troubadors, weaving the tenets of <A href="bword://Courtly Love">courtly love</A> with the actions of knights. The romances were one vehicle of expression that changed forever the popular perception of what a knight should be--driving the rough-hewn warrior ‘knight’ towards the more refined gentleman that would emerge. The romances put their vision of what knights should be alongside the <A href="bword://Church and Knights">church's</A> perception, the reality of what knights became being a fusion of all three influences--the knights themselves, influenced in turn by the <A href="bword://Court">court</A> and the church.

Modern tournament formats like the <A href="bword://Seven Sins Tourney">Seven Sins tourney</A> are examples of highly effective and entertaining round tables. Ladies often enjoyed a prominent role in these festivals, and the pageantry was often very striking.
Roundel	The round metal attachment at the base of a <a href="bword://Polearm">polearm</A> to keep the hands from sliding down the shaft and onto the blade, where they might be harmed. <BR>

Sabaton, Solleret|Sabaton|Solleret	Armour for the foot, usually consisting of articulated plates ending in a toecap. Plate sabatons seem to have made their appearance in the middle of the 14th century, remaining in common use throughout the 15th and 16th centuries. In the early 14th century, the foot was defended by <A href="bword://mail">mail</A> or scales, though no examples of these defenses remain apart from evidence on <A href="bword://Brass (funerary brass)">funerary brasses</A> . Milanese armour from the 15th century generally used mail for the defense of the foot rather than the solleret; the reason for this is unclear, especially since armour made in nearly every other region of Europe adopted the sabaton long before this.
Sable	The <A href="bword://Heraldry and Heralds">heraldic</A> term for the color black.
Sack of Limoges	{}
Safe-conduct	Passage allowed through a territory for peaceful purposes; it was often given to students, merchants, <A href="bword://Knight">knights</A> on their way to <A href="bword://Tournament (Tournoi)">tournament</A> , certain <A href="bword://Heraldry and Heralds">heralds</A> &amp; messengers, and pilgrims. Such safe-conducts could either be issued by the <A href="bword://Prince">Prince</A> of a region; these were general proclamations that bound the prince’s subjects to respect the passage. The other safe-conducts were offered by individual <A href="bword://Nobility">nobles</A> , issued as sealed guarantees, where the noble himself extended their own protection to the holder of the safe passage. These writs named a specific recipient by name, the number of people in his party allowed to pass, the goods they could carry. Other goods carried were subject to confiscation--this was not an uncommon occurrence. Knights on their way to tournament were frequently given such safe conducts, they are specifically mentioned in several <A href="bword://Tournament declaration">tournament declarations</A> .

Salle	Fr. Room or hall. The name Salle d’Armes became popularly used for a large hall used for the instruction of arms, first defined during the 17th century.
Sallet,  Salade|Salade|Sallet	A common helmet of the 15th century, varying in style according to national preferences and rapid changes in defensive requirements. Most sallets are characterized by a <A href="bword://flaring">flared</A> tail, drawn out either from a single or several attached pieces. Some sallets were fitted with <A href="bword://visor">visors</A> , while others were worn open-faced. Sallet design roughly followed the nationalistic style preferences represented by the <A href="bword://Milanese">Milanese</A> and <A href="bword://gothic armour">Gothic</A> styles, though there was a degree of overlap as armouries strove to create pieces in competition with their rivals. There is no clear distinction between a sallet and the <A href="bword://barbute">barbute</A> or the <A href="bword://armet">armet</A> ; there are pieces that are clearly both a sallet and a barbute or an armet. Generally the sallet was a lighter helmet that was in common use amongst the soldiery throughout the period, while the armet and barbute seem to have been more popular with the nobility, at least in Italy. In Germany the sallet held universal appeal, while in England and France all three styles were worn, imported from continental armouries for the best quality.
Sanctuary	The rule that allowed criminals not accused of infamy or felonies against Church property to seek refuge against the hew and cry issued when a felony was discovered. In most ecclesiastical properties, so long as no crime was committed against the church, a criminal could seek refuge for 40 days, after which they could be removed from the premises. In England, certain <A href="bword://Abbey">abbeys</A> had an extended right of sanctuary, extending about for a league or more, with no limit on time. At these abbeys wanted persons could remain indefinitely, part of the abbey community.
Sans Reproche	From the French, literally ‘without reproach’. During the 15th century this became a common tag to attach to <A href="bword://Knight">knights</A> of very high reputation--in the ideal, a knight should bear a <A href="bword://Renown">renown</A> such that no stain could be said to cloud a knight’s character. Because of the idealistic nature of the phrase, I see the phrase as a literal invocation of the ideal image, a useful tool both as a check on reality (see how far from the ideal we really are) and as a way to refocus the activities on the ideal rather than on the gritty reality. <A href="bword://Chivalry">Chivalry</A> always sought perfection, even if it always failed; ‘sans reproach’ was one way of shorthand reference to that ideal.

Sheriff	{}
Shield (construction of)|Shield|Shield construction|construction of Shield	The knight's shield of the 14th and 15th centuries was generally formed from wood, covered in gesso, and painted with his heraldic charge. Often the gesso was raised to give some texture to the shield, the back was covered in some kind of cloth, and finally <A href="bword://enarmes">enarmes</A> and a <A href="bword://guige">guige</A> were added so that the shield could be carried. The shield weighed no more than 6-10 lbs, usually leaning towards the lighter number. <BR>Modern shields use a variety of construction techniques to preserve them since labor is now much more expensive that it was during the high middle ages. Fiberglass, edging, and lacquer are all commonly used in an attempt to protect the shield. See also <A href="http://www.chronique.com/Chronique/chrniq08.htm">Chronique: The Journal of Chivalry #8</A>
Shield (knight's)|Shield|knight's Shield	Most knight's shields during the 14th century were of the familiar <A href="bword://heater">&quotheater"</A> shape, varying widely in size. Knights who are illustrated in tournaments usually carry a very small shield, while those in war often carry a larger one. This owes itself probably to the presence of highly dangerous missle weapons on the battlefield, something the tourneying knight did not have to worry about very often. Also, the tournament carries an element of sport that rarely existed in war, so the small shield might also have served to encourage deeds of aggressive prowess rather than defensive boredom for the gallery. <BR>Like his other accoutrement, the knight's shield came to take on symbolic meaning. A dishonored knight had his <A href="bword://spur">spurs</A> hacked off and his shield hung upside down in disgrace, which insinuates that the shield stood for the honor and renown of the knight, which makes sense since his heraldic blazon, the way he was known on the battlefield or tournament list, was known.
Shield Wall	A military formation of <A href="bword://Infantry">infantry</A> formed by condensing the <A href="bword://Shield (construction of)">shield</A> -carriers shoulder to shoulder, making penetration of the wall difficult. If the infantry were well disciplined, then, as they did at the <A href="bword://Hastings, Battle of">Battle of Hastings</A> , the wall can sometimes repel a determined attack by <A href="bword://Cavalry">cavalry</A> . A shield wall also defends some of the combatants against attacks by missile weapons (arrows, etc.). <BR>Within the <A href="bword://Society for Creative Anachronism (SCA)">SCA</A> , the shield wall is a dominant tactic employed by infantry units. The most effective shield walls involve rectangular or oval shields, generally large ones. SCA units tend to use <A href="bword://Spear">spears</A> as heavy cavalry, their aggressive pikemen attacking the shield wall. Most such walls are defended in the second rank by slashing <A href="bword://Polearm">polearms</A> or their own spears, an attempt to keep would-be penetrators from getting too close to the wall. When one shieldman is slain, another comes forward to take their place, plugging the hole. These defenses are must useful in narrow passes such as on bridges where the <A href="bword://Flank">flanks</A> are anchored. In the field, the wall is exposed, to a degree, and the best tactic to break a wall is generally to attack the flanks, distracting the corner anchors and besieging the unit on two or more fronts.
Shilling	{}

Shire	{}
Siege	Military blockade of a city or fortification, designed to force it to surrender. The besiegers used three main techniques; close assault, bombardment, and capitulation. In close assault, they would place towers and tunnels trying to defeat the walls of the fortification, generally conducted after a period of bombardment with <A href="bword://Archer">archery</A> , ballista, trebuchets, <A href="bword://Catapult">catapults</A> , and even cannons. If the fortification would not fall to direct assault, a difficult and expensive proposition, or the defenders would not give over the keys (sometimes using parlay the attackers and besiegers would agree on a specific length of time the defenders would do their best to hold out unless relieved by a friendly army), then the attackers would try to keep new supplies out of the fortress, causing privation within and usually forcing capitulation.

Society for Creative Anachronism (SCA)|Anachronism|SCA|Society for Creative|scaaa	The largest of the medieval ‘re-enactment’ societies,established in 1968 at the home of Diana Paxton.

This ‘medieval marshal art’ has become immensely popular in the United States, with active branches in Australia, Japan, Korea, Britain, Germany, Sweden, and Canada. At its finest, the Society strives to use the martial system to teach chivalric virtues, a place where the curious can come and experience something of the medieval experience. <a href="bword://Knight">Knights</A> in the SCA are made by the <a href="bword://King">king</A> in recognition of their <a href="bword://Prowess">prowess</A> , <a href="bword://Courtesy">courtesy</A> , and <a href="bword://Nobility (ideal)">noble</A> demeanor; knights often take <a href="bword://Squire">‘squires’</A> , less expert combatants who wish to learn the chivalric arts.

Spangen helmet	The early <A href="bword://Helmet">helmets</A> derived from their Roman predecessors, the 'spangen' helmet, popular during the 7th - 11th centuries, consisted of a several small plates of <A href="bword://iron">iron</A> or <A href="bword://latten">latten</A> bound together with various patterns of banding, all held together with many <A href="bword://rivets">rivets</A> . A few surviving examples in the <A href="bword://Metropolitan Museum of Art">Metropolitan Museum of Art</A> show evidence of gold gilding or wash, and there are written references to the helmets of local chieftains being adorned with precious metals and stones. Most spangen helmets were doubtless manufactured locally, since large sheets of *iron plate were hard to come by until the middle of the 14th century.
Spatha	The cavalry <A href="bword://sword">sword</A> of the romans, between 36" - 40" in length, made from <A href="bword://iron">iron</A> . The shape of the hilt is unknown to us, as only a few blades have survived. These blades can easily be confused with their Medieval counterparts, which were of approximately the same length and shape. The Roman footsoldier wielded a much shorter chopping and thrusting sword called the <A href="bword://gladius">gladius</A> .
Spaulder	The 14th and 15th century defense for the shoulder point, featuring a small <A href="bword://dishing">dished</A> defense for the shoulder point and a number of <A href="bword://lames">lames</A> extending down the arm. During the 14th century these lames were generally attached permanently to the <A href="bword://rerebrace">rerebrace</A> , but during the 15th century many designs separated the spaulder into a separate piece. As the desire for greater and greater defense increased the demand for full plate protection, the size of the spaulder was increased to cover the armpit and even part of the back and chest, at which point modern scholars have separated out the term <A href="bword://pauldron">pauldron</A> to classify these more extensive defenses.
Spear	&quotThe oldest form of staff weapon, intended primarily for thrusting. The war spear usually had a long, leaf-shaped or long, thin, triangular head."-David Edge and John Miles Paddock, Arms and Armour of the Medieval Knight. In common use during the entire middle ages, the spear ranged in length from five to nine feet, at which point modern scholars begin referring to them as <A href="bword://pike">pikes</A> rather than spears.
Spearmen	Footsoldiers, generally not of the <A href="bword://Knight">knightly</A> class, armed with a <A href="bword://Pike">pike</A> or <A href="bword://Spear">spear</A> , generally arranged into dense formations. These soldiers, when disciplined, were a potent defense against the heavily armoured <A href="bword://Cavalry">cavalry</A> , particularly where missile weapons were scarce or where the field could be restricted, such as in the Swiss or Greek mountains (the swiss pikemen of the 16th century were as <A href="bword://Renown">renown</A> as their predecessors in the Greek Phalanx had been two millennia before).

See <A href="http://www.chronique.com/Chronique/chrniq13.htm">Chronique #13, The Knightly Sword</A> .
Splinted defense	Usually used on arm and leg defenses during the 14th and very early 15th century, the idea was to add longitudinal strips of reinforcing to a heavier <A href="bword://leather">leather</A> gutter that formed the <A href="bword://vambrace">vambrace</A> and another that formed the <A href="bword://rerebrace">rerebrace</A> . The <A href="bword://couter">couter</A> was generally, but not always, attached with internal straps rather than <A href="bword://articulation">articulated</A> with <A href="bword://lames">lames</A> . The leather vambrace and rerebrace are often depicted in surviving effigies and <A href="bword://brass">brasses</A> as being tooled; the strips might have been formed from <A href="bword://iron">iron</A> , brass, bronze, or <A href="bword://latten">latten</A> , though iron was probably the most common. Especially popular in Germany and in Italy during the whole of the <A href="bword://transitional period">transitional period</A> . (See Blair p. 64)
Spur	The y-shaped hardware attached to the heel by straps, the spur was one of the essential tools a knight possessed as an equestrian, and they became on of the dominant symbols of knighthood. Prior to the late 13th century simple &quotprick" type spurs were in wide use, but during the last two decades of the 13th century and into the 14th the &quotrowel" spur gained wide popularity. <BR>14th century rowel spurs had a shank ranging in length from two to more than nine inches, with a <A href="bword://flaring">flared</A> tongue that allowed the spur to ride up the ankle slightly without causing discomfort. Made of bronze, brass and <A href="bword://iron">iron</A> , these spurs were probably both cast and forged, depending upon the preferences of the craftsman. Rowels were generally sharp wheels, sometimes decorated with fascinating piercework patterns. 15th century spurs were generally much the same, but during the 16th century the shanks were shortened and more spikes added to the rowel. <BR>Spurs were generally attached to the foot with one strap running under the foot and other over the foot, these straps affixed to the spur itself by metal clips that had rings at the other end passing through a hole at the apex of each fork of the &quotY" shape. The underside strap was generally made in one piece while the spur was fastened into place in top of the foot using a decorative <A href="bword://buckles">buckle</A> .
Spurs	Pointed devices attached to a <A href="bword://Knight">knight’s</A> heel used to urge a horse. When they first came into existence, along with the stirrup and couched <A href="bword://Lance (weapon used in the joust)">lance</A> , they extended a knight’s ability to control a horse in combat. According to the <A href="bword://Ordene de Chevalrie">Ordene de Chevalerie</A> , the spurs symbolized {}. In <A href="bword://Book of the Order of Chivalry">Ramon Lull</A> , they were said to symbolize {}.
Squire	A young man in training to become a <A href="bword://Knight">knight</A> . During the 14th century arming squires often joined their knights in battle, a part of the knight’s <A href="bword://Household knights">household</A> unit or <A href="bword://Lance (unit organization)">lance</A> . See <A href="http://www.chronique.com/Chronique/chrniq08.htm">Chronique, The Journal of Chivalry #8</A> . In the words of Ramon Lull:<BR><I>&quotThe knowledge and the school of chivalry is such that the knight makes his son to learn in his youth to ride, for if should take on the keeping of a horse. It behooves him also that he serve, and that he be the first subject of the lord, for otherwise he will not know the nobility of lordship when he should become a knight. And therefore every man who will come to knighthood should learn, in his youth, to carve at the table, to serve, to arm and to adoube a knight; for in likewise as a maid will learn to sew in order to be a tailor or a man to be a carpenter it behooves em to have a master who can sew or hew. Likewise it behooves that a noble man who loves the order of chivalry and will be a knight to have first a master who is a knight, for thus it is a discovenable thing that a squire should learn the order and nobility from any other man than a knight. So very high and honored is the order of chivalry that a squire should suffer himself not only to learn to keep horse and learn to serve a knight, that he go with him to tourneys and battles; but it is necessary that he beholds the school of the order of knighthood."</I> <BR>See also: John Harding's poetic fragment <a href="http://www.chronique.com/Library/Knights/harding.htm">Training of a Squire</A> <BR>In the SCA, squires are taken by knights in a variety of roles: teacher/student, friend/friend, father/son. Each relationship is<BR>different, but the essence of each is generally a trade of teaching and guidance on one and for service on the other.

Originally 500 <a href="bword://Knight">knights</A> were admitted into the Company; by their charter John was their president, they would meet at the Noble Maison once per year for a grand feast at which they would exchange their deeds of the past year, and that members of the order would be taken care of with a pension from the Company when they were too old to maintain their estates. Unfortunately, their charter also dictated that they would never flee more than 100 arpents from any battle, a declaration which resulted in the death of most of the Star companions at the Battle of Mauron (13xx), the rest were slain at the <a href="bword://Poitiers, Battle of">Battle of Poitiers</A> in 1356. <BR><BR>Geoffrey de Charnay, a founding member of the Company, was one of the last Companions, slain carrying the <a href="bword://Oriflamme">Oriflamme</A>.
Statum Armorum in Torniamentis|Statum Armorum	Rules for <A href="bword://Tournament (Tournoi)">tournaments</A> set down in 1265 under Edward I, the first rules for the tournament yet documented. The rules specified how many <A href="bword://Squire">squires</A> a <A href="bword://Knight">knight</A> could bring to tournament, that such squires should not carry a pointed <A href="bword://Sword">sword</A> , <A href="bword://Dagger">dagger</A> or staff.

Steel, as a material for armour|Steel|Steel as a material for armour	Used in armour chiefly during the 15th, 16th and 17th centuries, steel was occasionally found by accident and incorporated into earlier <A href="http://www.chronique.com/Library/Glossaries/glossary-AA/arms_h.htm#harness">harnesses</A> . Steel is made by adding carbon to <A href="http://www.chronique.com/Library/Glossaries/glossary-AA/arms_i.htm#iron">iron</A> , but the process was not applied to plate harness until the early 15th century, although this might prove too late as armouries were secretive in their techniques and there might have been houses, particularly the <A href="bword://Missiglia">Missiglian</A> or some of the better German houses, that might have known and used steel rather than iron prior to that. <BR>The amount of carbon in steel from which armour was made varies from 0.1% (low carbon) to 0.6% (high carbon). Heterogeneous steels have an uneven distribution of carbon, while heterogeneous steels have a uniform distribution of carbon. Modern mild steels are similar in the amount of carbon present to the lower grade medieval metals, but they are homogeneous rather than heterogeneous. Modern stainless steels have trace amounts of chromium, nickel, silicon, tungsten and vanadium, contain no <A href="bword://slag">slag</A> , and <A href="bword://Polish, finish appropriate for the 14th century">polish</A> to a much whiter finish than medieval steels.

Sugarloaf	A transition helmet between the <A href="bword://heaulm">heaulm</A> and the <A href="bword://bascinet">bascinet</A> where the skull of the helmet was pointed like a bascinet and the sides enclosed like a heaulm. Both were worn until the third quarter of the century, when the <A href="bword://visor">visored</A> bascinet emerged as dominant. Sugarloafs were often adorned with a cross of brass, bronze or <A href="bword://latten">latten</A> across the front and decorated with <A href="bword://torse">torses</A> and <A href="bword://mantling">mantles</A> , especially since they were frequently worn in tournaments and in jousts.
Surcoat	A cloth covering usually worn over the body armour. During the 14th century they were gradually shortened from their 13th century lines. They started during the first quarter of the century ending at the knee, and ended the century ending at the edge of the hip. During the 15th century they were shortened further, and eventually abandoned in favor of a large tunic worn over the <A href="bword://cuirass">cuirass</A> . The addition of <A href="bword://white armour">white armour</A> made the use of a surcoat less important, as full <A href="bword://harness">harnesses</A> were generally somewhat individual. Most surcoats were emblazoned with the <A href="bword://cote of arms">cote of arms</A> or device or the wearer in order that they identity be known in the crush of battle.
Sword	The predominant weapon of the knight; a long, tapered, usually two-edged blade ranging from 32" to more than 72" in length ending in a point which was sometimes, but not always, used for thrusting. For most of the period from the 9th century to the end of the 15th century, the <A href="bword://broadsword">broadsword</A> remained the mainstay weapon for knights, squires and men-at-arms. Swords generally weigh less than popular culture would have you believe; the finest weapon I have handled was one purported to belong to Edward III; it was nearly 40" in length and weighed in at only 3 1/2 pounds. The pommels on many swords are thicker than they appear in most two dimensional illustrations, being heavy to counter the blade. The sword also came to possess strong symbolic meanings, different virtues being assigned tot he two edges. The quillion (a 16th century term) or cross-piece formed across the handle of the sword resembled a Christian cross, furthering the symbolism.

Templar, Knights (Knights of the Temple)|Knights Templar|Knights of the Temple	Founded in the <A href="bword://Holy Lands">Holy Land</A> in 1119 to guard the site of the Temple of Solomon and to protect pilgrims en route to visit the site. Because many of the <A href="bword://Crusader">Crusaders</A> returned home after the first <A href="bword://Crusade">crusade</A> and the capture of Jerusalem in 1099, there was a shortage of soldiers to provide this steady stream of pilgrims who where harassed and ambushed by brigands and by Muslim irregular forces. Hugh de Payns and Godefroi de Saint Omer, two <A href="bword://Knight">knights</A> , swore an <A href="bword://Oath">oath</A> to defend the pilgrims, taking an oath of poverty, <A href="bword://Chastity">chastity</A> , obedience, stylizing themselves as knights but in the tradition of the monasteries. These were the first ‘monks of the sword,’ men whose devotion to <A href="bword://Faith">faith</A> as soldiers of Christ bore the full fruit of the <A href="bword://Church and Knights">church</A> efforts to ‘civilize’ the early knights. <BR>In 1130, Bernard of Clairvaux drew up the rules for the <A href="bword://Orders of knighthood">order</A> in the Praise of New Knighthood. Bernard set up the order with two main classes of knighthood, the knights and sergeants or serving brethren. Sergeants or serving brothers wore a <A href="bword://Black">black</A> or brown <A href="bword://Mantling">mantle</A> to show their lower status, while the Knights wore a red cross granted by Pope Eugenius III. Married men who joined the order could only join as sergeants, their property coming into the possession of the Order rather than to their wives upon their death. <BR>The Knights Templar were amazingly successful, attracting men of all stations to serve in their illustrious ranks. Famous knights from all over England took up the mantle of the Templars, even William Marshal took a kind of associate membership, being buried in Templar silk. The Templars received lavish gifts both from knights who joined their ranks and from men wanting to increase their fame by demonstrating their <A href="bword://Largesse">largesse</A> , to the point where the Templars set up a huge banking industry and were perhaps the richest single entity, next to the Church, at the point when they were brought down. <BR>This amazing story culminated in 1308 when king Philip IV of France, charged their leader with witchcraft and heresy, seizing the Temple assets for fear of their immense power. Persecution followed this instance, the popular notion of ‘poor knights’ operating a large, successful international banking operation and possessing huge, luxurious estates feeding jealousy and making the irony obvious for everyone. The Templars were destroyed at this point, though some popular legend has them going underground. <BR>Another similar order, the <A href="bword://Hospitallers">Hospitallers</A> , survived and still exist today.
Tenans	The defenders in a <A href="bword://Pas d’Armes">pas d’armes</A> ; those who sponsor the passage, set up the <A href="bword://Pavilion">pavilions</A> , provide the refreshments, and some tokens of recognition to those who come to challenge them, who are known as the <A href="bword://Venans">venans</A> .

Teutonic Knights (Teutonic Knights of the Hospital of the Blessed Virgin)|Teutonic Knights|Teutonic Knights of the Hospital of the Blessed Virgin	A military-religious <A href="bword://Orders of knighthood">order of knights</A> that restricted membership to Germans. They were part of the original <A href="bword://Hospitallers">Hospitallers</A> , but under Hermann von Salza they split from the main branch and founded their own order, taking on a very distinctive white cloak bearing a stark <A href="bword://Black">black</A> cross on the left shoulder. Upon the fall of Acre in 1291 they retired to Venice where Emperor Frederick II commissioned them to convert the heathens in Prussia, Lithuania, and Estonia, becoming a very successful order headquartered in Marienburg from 1309-1509.
Three-day’s tournament	A <A href="bword://Romances">romantic</A> literary device where the <A href="bword://Knight">knightly</A> champion could appear at a <A href="bword://Tournament (Tournoi)">tournament</A> for three successive days in different colored <A href="bword://Armour (Armor)">armour</A> , all incognito, winning <A href="bword://Renown">renown</A> by his deeds of <A href="bword://Prowess">prowess</A> rather than through his already established reputation. Such literary usages gave rise to similar formats in the medieval tournament as a festival, where different forms of combat were done on different days. See especially <A href="bword://René-style Tournament">King René’s style of tournament</A> . Such ‘three day’s tournaments’ were found in Cliges, Richard Coeur de Lion, and Sir Gowther.
Thrust	The technique of pushing with the end of a weapon to pierce with the tip, usually based on speed and surprise, as well as position.

Tithe	Literally a &quottenth", a medieval form of tax often owed to the <A href="bword://Liege">liege</A> lord or to the church as rent on land. Sometimes the tithe could be as much as thirty percent, but ten or fifteen was normal. When tithes were collected no other taxes were normally due on the property, and the tithe seems to have been a percent of production, not value.
Torchlight Tournament	See <A href="bword://Pas Noire">pas noire</A> .
Torse	A colorful cloth roll worn around the crown of the helmet, from which the <a href="bword://mantling">mantling</A> or cloth decoration was attached. Used from the 13th century through the 15th, torses and mantling helped to identify the knight in war and provided a colorful expressive tool for tournaments and pageants of the 15th century.<BR>

The tournament began as a training for war, and was gradually more regulated and specialized. During the 14th century the tournament proper, the hastilude, was gradually supplanted by the <A href="bword://Joust">jousts</A> and foot combats described in pas d’armes and round tables. <A href="bword://Knight">Knights</A> would compete against one another under the watchful eyes of the <A href="bword://Heraldry and Heralds">heralds</A> and ladies of the <A href="bword://Gallery">gallery</A> , earning <A href="bword://Renown">renown</A> and fame while they demonstrated their <A href="bword://Prowess">prowess</A> .

Tournament declaration	The challenge and set of rules generally circulated to stir excitement for a <A href="bword://Tournament (Tournoi)">tournament</A> or <A href="bword://Pas d’Armes">pas d’armes</A> . Generally in the form of an introduction (that tells who the defenders--the <A href="bword://Tenans">tenans</A> --are), a time and place, the rules to be followed, whether weapons and <A href="bword://Armour (Armor)">armour</A> will be provided, and what <A href="bword://Prize Tournament">prizes</A> or penalties might be incurred or expected from victory. Modern <A href="bword://Tournament Society">tournament companies</A> have begun using the declaration for the same purpose; see the <A href="http://www.chronique.com/george.htm">Company of Saint George</A> <A href="http://www.chronique.com/CSG/antirdec.htm">tournament declarations</A> in the <A href="http://www.chronique.com">Knighthood, Chivalry &amp; Tournaments Resource Library</A> .

Tournament Society	Because of the rising cost and logistical difficulties involved in sponsoring a <A href="bword://Tournament (Tournoi)">tournament</A> , during the early and mid 14th century groups of <A href="bword://Knight">knights</A> in the Bavarian region of Germany banded themselves into small groups for the purposes of sponsoring and participating in tournaments. Barber and Barker (1989) put forth a theory that it was because of these societies that the tournament was more common in Germany than in France or England, and the tournament companies were responsible for their proliferation. <BR>For one of these societies, the tournament was to act as an annual assembly, whose members wore the same livery and held a <A href="bword://Court">court</A> at the same tournament, to which they were to bring their wives and daughters in order to ‘bring <A href="bword://Honor">honor</A> to the society,’ during which they were to conduct their annual business. All members are to attend, or were fined. A council of four was named to oversee the membership, and members were to help one another in times of war. They founded a chapel in Freising. All members were to own <A href="bword://Horse, use of">war-horses</A> if they were able. Some German societies elected a <A href="bword://King">king</A> to oversee their members. According to Barker and Barber, "...the society was intended to offer a suitable atmosphere in which <A href="bword://Chivalry">chivalric</A> culture could flourish." We have definite records of societies in existence from 1387 to the 1430s, but it is likely that they existed both before and after this. <BR>Within the <A href="bword://Society for Creative Anachronism (SCA)">SCA</A> , the Tournament Societies and the Monarchical knightly orders (the <A href="bword://Garter, Order of the">Garter</A> and <A href="bword://Star, Order of the">Star</A> , for example) proved the direct inspiration for the formation of the tournament companies, groups of knights, <A href="bword://Man-at-Arms">men-at-arms</A> , and ladies dedicated to particular aspects of the tournament experience. <BR>Unfortunately, very little research has been done on the historical tournament societies; presumably some of their documentation lies buried in the German records, to be found by an enterprising scholar.
Tournament Teams|Tournament Team	Within the <A href="bword://Society for Creative Anachronism (SCA)">SCA</A> , the names given to permanent <A href="bword://Conroi">conroi</A> of <A href="bword://Knight">knights</A> and <A href="bword://Man-at-Arms">men-at-arms</A> who come together with the aim of a more uniform, <A href="bword://Heraldry and Heralds">heraldic</A> flavor to their field appearance, a concern for the quality and authenticity of their equipment, and a focus on knightly behavior. In the Middle Kingdom, these teams have also done a great deal of work towards promulgating the more authentic format of <A href="bword://Tournament (Tournoi)">tournament</A> , where teams of knights compete for the <A href="bword://Prize Tournament">prize</A> .

Tournaments, Rules for|Rules for Tournaments	In the earliest records relating to <A href="bword://Tournament (Tournoi)">tournaments</A> , it is clear that these engagements were not what we might now think of as tournaments, with their <A href="bword://Color">color</A> and <A href="bword://Pageant">pageantry</A> , but were rather all but real <A href="bword://Battle (bataille)">battles</A> , ‘simulacra of battle’, as they have been called, where opposing groups of <A href="bword://Knight">knights</A> used weapons of war in a test engagement to hone the skills required for coordinated <A href="bword://Cavalry">cavalry</A> actions and close-order charges. Indeed, some of the early records have footmen and in one instance even <A href="bword://Arbalestier">crossbowmen</A> present at the ‘tourney’. All too often these vaguely friendly events trampled fields, caused injury to bystanders, and occasionally broke down to full-scale warfare, as in the <A href="bword://Little Battle of Châlons">Little Battle of Châllons</A> , where Edward I almost fell in a tourney where more than seventy knights were killed. It was events such as these, and the tendency of the English <A href="bword://Baron">barons</A> to use the ‘tournament’ as an excuse for gathering to plot against their <A href="bword://King">king</A> , that the first rules came into being. These rules at first limited only where tournaments could take place (Richard I’s licensing), but later came to become more and more restrictive. Few of these rules were published; specific rules were often apparent in the <A href="bword://Tournament declaration">tournament declaration</A> , but there are many references that indicate that the unwritten ‘laws of war’ covered tournaments as well. The <A href="bword://Church and Tournaments">church</A> attempted to restrict the tournament as well, at first through the <A href="bword://Peace of God">Peace and Truces of God</A> , and later by outright ban on all ‘tournamentum’ activities. Though ultimately unsuccessful, these efforts did cause the form of the tournament to be modified, which, together with the increasing presence of spectators, changed forever how tournaments were fought. <A href="bword://Richard I’s Tournament Decree (1194)">Richard I’s tournament licensing</A> <A href="bword://Statum Armorum in Torniamentis">Statum Tournemanteaum</A> <A href="bword://Tiptof, Sir John, Tournament Rules">Sir John Tiptoff’s rules</A> <A href="bword://Heilbronn Ordinances, 1485">Heilbronn Ordinances, 1485</A>

Vassal	Originally the comitatus of German relations where a man would offer his services in return for the protection of a <A href="bword://Lord">lord</A> . By the 12th century, these contracts had become more formalized, and a vassal generally sought to closely define the terms of vassalage and to make the relationship hereditary as a way of providing for offspring. During the Middle Ages a vassal was a free man who voluntarily exchanged his service, sometimes military service, in exchange for protection. A vassal swore an <A href="bword://Oath of Fealty">oath of fealty</A> to the <A href="bword://Liege">liege</A> lord, who swore a return oath to defend the vassal. This contract, enhanced by the personal bond of homage, tied feudal relationships together and insured a measure of continuity and predictability, stability that allowed society to grow and develop out of the <A href="bword://Feudalism">feudal</A> age.

There is little mention of the practice before the late 15th century, yet it has become an iconographic part of the knightly image. <BR>Modern knights in the <A href="bword://Society for Creative Anachronism (SCA)">SCA</A> hold their vigils all night, from ‘dusk till dawn’, often attended by other knights of high <A href="bword://Renown">renown</A> , who speak to the candidate about what it means to be a knight.
Villein	A bondsman, a man bonded to the land that he worked. Villeins lived in villages, attached to a <A href="bword://Lord">lord</A> ’s holdings, all but a slave. A lord who owned the land to which a villein was attached could do anything with him he pleased, save mutilation or killing him. Villeins had few rights, and only in rare circumstances were released from their bondage. Under Henry I, this ceremony had to be conducted in a public place such as in a church or marketplace, that many gained knowledge of the release and the villein, now a freeman, was not considered to have fled his <A href="bword://Feudalism">feudal</A> contract. A man was a villein if his father was a villein; only by the release of the lord could be ever be free. <BR>Villeins held few rights, unable to fish in the lord’s rivers, to hunt or draw firewood from his forests, marry his daughter off without permission (and a fee, generally), or commit his son to Holy Orders.

Vow of the Heron	Part of the tactics used by Robert d’Artois to get Edward III to conduct his campaign against the French. One day, the expatriated French <A href="bword://Knight">knight</A> and <A href="bword://Count">count</A> witnessed a hawk taking down a heron, and reportedly this gave him his idea. He had a heron cooked and prepared, led into the <A href="bword://King">king</A> ’s hall led by guitarists, lutists, and two ladies of gentle birth. He presented the bird to Edward, exclaiming that since the heron was the most cowardly of all birds, it was appropriate that it should be presented to His Majesty, since Edward had allowed himself to be deprived of his Kingdom of France. Furious, the king vowed that he would indeed reclaim his throne of France, sending the bird around to secure <A href="bword://Vows">vows</A> of the knights present that they would also accompany him on this new campaign. It is not known whether this is actually what happened or if Edward engineered the event to capitalize on a public opportunity to make his designs on France known, but it is well within the capabilities of what we know of d’Artois to have engineered such a fiasco.
Vows	A <A href="bword://Knight">knightly</A> promise to accomplish some feat, usually a military feat in meeting a number of challengers, conducting <A href="bword://Joust">jousts</A> , or campaigning against an enemy.
