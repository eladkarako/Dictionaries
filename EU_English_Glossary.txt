"Multi-speed" Europe|Multi-speed Europe	"Multi-speed" Europe is the term used to describe the idea of a method of differentiated integration whereby common objectives are pursued by a group of Member States both able and willing to advance, it being implied that the others will follow later.<BR><BR>See:<BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Closer cooperation">Closer cooperation</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Single institutional framework">Single institutional framework</A> <BR><BR>
"New-look" NATO|New-look NATO	"New-look" NATO refers to the process of redefining the organisation's role and operation. The key aspects involved are the recognition of a European defence identity, the strengthening of the European component of the transatlantic security system, the new role of the WEU, and the prospect of the eastward enlargement of NATO - initially taking in Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic - as agreed at the North Atlantic Council meeting in Madrid in July 1997.<BR><BR>This will be accompanied by a deepening of NATO's relations with third countries through partnerships for peace and the North Atlantic Cooperation Council. A major challenge in this connection is that of establishing a sound, stable and sustainable partnership with Russia and Ukraine.<BR><BR>See:<BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Collective defence">Collective defence</A> <BR>•<A HREF="bword://Common foreign and security policy (CFSP)">Common foreign and security policy (CFSP)</A> <BR>•<A HREF="bword://European Security and Defence Policy (ESDP)">European Security and Defence Policy (ESDP)</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://NATO">NATO</A> <BR>•<A HREF="bword://Western European Union (WEU)">Western European Union (WEU)</A><BR><BR>
"Variable-geometry" Europe|Variable-geometry Europe	"Variable-geometry" Europe is the term used to describe the idea of a method of differentiated integration which acknowledges that there are irreconcilable differences within the integration structure and therefore allows for a permanent separation between a group of Member States and a number of less developed integration units.<BR><BR>See:<BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Closer cooperation">Closer cooperation</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Single institutional framework">Single institutional framework</A> <BR><BR>
Abstention, constructive (positive abstention)|constructive abstention|positive abstention	Constructive abstention is the idea of allowing a Member State to abstain on a vote in Council under the common foreign and security policy, without blocking a unanimous decision.<BR><BR>This option was introduced by the Treaty of Amsterdam in the new Article 23 of the EU Treaty. If constructive abstention is accompanied by a formal declaration, the Member State in question is not obliged to apply the decision but must accept that it commits the Union. The Member State must then refrain from any action that might conflict with Union action based on that decision.<BR><BR>See:<BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Common foreign and security policy (CFSP)">Common foreign and security policy (CFSP)</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Treaty of Amsterdam">Treaty of Amsterdam</A><BR><BR>
Accession criteria (Copenhagen criteria)|Accession criteria|Copenhagen criteria	In June 1993, the Copenhagen European Council recognised the right of the countries of central and eastern Europe to join the European Union when they have fulfilled three criteria:<BR><BR>•political: stable institutions guaranteeing democracy, the rule of law, human rights and respect for minorities;<BR>•economic: a functioning market economy;<BR>•incorporation of the Community <I>acquis: </I>adherence to the various political, economic and monetary aims of the European Union.<BR><BR>These accession criteria were confirmed in December;1995 by the Madrid European Council, which also stressed the importance of adapting the applicant countries' administrative structures to create the conditions for a gradual, harmonious integration. <BR><BR>However, the Union reserves the right to decide when it will be ready to accept new members. <BR><BR>See:<BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Accession partnership">Accession partnership</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Applicant countries">Applicant countries</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Enlargement">Enlargement</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Incorporation of the Community acquis">Incorporation of the Community acquis</A><BR><BR>
Accession negotiations	The applications of 10 Central and Eastern European countries were given a favourable reception at the Luxembourg European Council (December 1997). The official accession negotiations then proceeded in two phases. On 30 March 1998, negotiations began with six "first wave" countries (Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Poland, and Slovenia). The "second wave" candidate countries (Bulgaria, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Romania and Slovakia) began negotiations in February 2000, when it was felt that their reforms had made rapid enough progress.<BR><BR>Before negotiations opened, an evaluation of each applicant country's legislation was carried out to set up a work programme and define negotiating positions. <BR><BR>The accession negotiations examine the applicants' capacity to fulfil the requirements of a Member State and to apply the body of Community laws (the "<I>acquis</I>") at the time of their accession, in particular the measures required to extend the single market, which will have to be implemented immediately. The negotiations also look at the issue of the pre-accession aid the European Union may provide in order to help with the incorporation of the <I>acquis</I>. The negotiations can be concluded even if the <I>acquis</I> has not been fully transposed, as transitional arrangements can be applied after accession.<BR><BR>The negotiations proper take the form of bilateral Intergovernmental Conferences (European Union/applicant country), bringing the ministers together every six months and the ambassadors every month. The common negotiating positions have been defined by the Commission for each of the chapters relating to matters of Community competence and approved unanimously by the Council. The results of the negotiations are incorporated in a draft accession treaty. This must be approved by the Union and ratified by the Member States and the applicant countries.<BR><BR>At the Copenhagen European Council (12 and 13 December 2002), the Commission concluded the negotiations with 10 applicant countries: the Czech Republic, Cyprus, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia, thus enabling them to join the Union on 1 May 2004. As far as Bulgaria and Romania are concerned, the goal is to conclude negotiations in time for them to join in 2007. The possibility of opening negotiations with Turkey will be examined in December 2004.<BR><BR>See:<BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Accession partnership">Accession partnership</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Applicant countries">Applicant countries</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Bilateral Intergovernmental Conference (EU-Applicant countries)">Bilateral Intergovernmental Conference (EU-Applicant countries)</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Community acquis">Community acquis</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Enlargement">Enlargement</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://European Conference">European Conference</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Incorporation of the Community acquis">Incorporation of the Community acquis</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Pre-accession aid">Pre-accession aid</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Pre-accession strategy">Pre-accession strategy</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Programme of Community aid to the countries of Central and Eastern Europe (Phare)">Programme of Community aid to the countries of Central and Eastern Europe (Phare)</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Screening">Screening</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://TAIEX (Technical Assistance Information Exchange Office)">TAIEX (Technical Assistance Information Exchange Office)</A><BR><BR>
Accession of new Member States to the European Union	Accession of new Member States to the European Union is provided for in Article 49 (former Article O) of the EU Treaty. The Council must agree unanimously to open negotiations, after consulting the Commission and receiving the assent of the European Parliament. The conditions of admission, any transition periods and adjustments to the Treaties on which the Union is founded must be the subject of an agreement between the applicant country and the Member State. To enter into force, the agreement requires ratification by all the contracting States in accordance with their respective constitutional requirements.<BR><BR>See:<BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Bilateral Intergovernmental Conference (EU-Applicant countries)">Bilateral Intergovernmental Conference (EU-Applicant countries)</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Enlargement">Enlargement</A><BR><BR>
Accession partnership	The accession partnerships concluded by the Council in 1998 with each of the applicant countries (with the exception of Cyprus, Malta and Turkey), bring together in one document the aid provided by the European Community to each applicant country and set priorities for each sector in transposing Community law (the <I>acquis</I>).<BR><BR>Following the accession partnership, each country drew up a detailed programme for the adoption of the Community <I>acquis</I> so as to organise the implementation of these priorities, committing itself to a timetable and indicating the human and financial resources needed to achieve it. These programmes and the accession partnerships are adjusted over time by the Commission and the country concerned. <BR><BR>The accession partnerships have served as a support for other pre-accession instruments, including the joint assessment of medium-term economic policy priorities, the pact on organised crime, the national development plans and other sectoral programmes necessary for participation in the Structural Funds after accession and for the implementation of ISPA (Instrument for Structural Policies for Pre-Accession) and SAPARD (Special Accession Programme for Agriculture and Rural Development). They have also been the starting point for the development of action plans to improve administrative and judicial capacities in the applicant countries.<BR><BR>See:<BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Applicant countries">Applicant countries</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Community acquis">Community acquis</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Incorporation of the Community acquis">Incorporation of the Community acquis</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Pre-accession aid">Pre-accession aid</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Pre-accession pact on organised crime">Pre-accession pact on organised crime</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Programme of Community aid to countries of Central and Eastern Europe (Phare)">Programme of Community aid to countries of Central and Eastern Europe (Phare)</A><BR><BR>
Agenda 2000	Agenda 2000 is an action programme adopted by the Commission on 15 July 1997 as an official response to requests by the Madrid European Council in December 1995 that it present a general document on enlargement and the reform of the common policies and a communication on the Union's future financial framework after 31 December 1999. Agenda 2000 tackles all the questions facing the Union at the beginning of the 21st century. Attached to it are the Commission's opinions on the countries that have applied for Union membership.<BR><BR>Agenda 2000 is in three parts:<BR><BR>•the first addresses the question of the European Union's internal operation, particularly the reform of the common agricultural policy and of the policy of economic and social cohesion. It also contains recommendations on how to face the challenge of enlargement in the best possible conditions and proposes putting in place a new financial framework for the period 2000-06;<BR>•the second proposes a reinforced pre-accession strategy, incorporating two new elements: the partnership for accession and extended participation of the applicant countries in Community programmes and the mechanisms for applying the Community <I>acquis</I>; <BR>•the third consists of a study on the impact of the effects of enlargement on European Union policies.<BR><BR>These priorities were fleshed out in some twenty legislative proposals put forward by the European Commission in 1998. The Berlin European Council reached an overall political agreement on the legislative package in 1999 with the result that the measures were adopted the same year. They cover four closely linked areas for the period 2000 to 2006:<BR><BR>•reform of the common agricultural policy,<BR>•reform of the structural policy,<BR>•pre-accession instruments,<BR>•financial framework.<BR><BR>See:<BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Accession partnership">Accession partnership</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Deepening">Deepening</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Enlargement">Enlargement</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Financial perspective 2000-2006">Financial perspective 2000-2006</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Incorporation of the Community acquis">Incorporation of the Community acquis</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Objectives 1, 2 and 3">Objectives 1, 2 and 3</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Pre-accession strategy">Pre-accession strategy</A><BR><BR>
Animal welfare	The question of animal welfare was first addressed in a declaration attached to the EC Treaty on the occasion of the 1991-92 Intergovernmental Conference on political union.<BR><BR>In its "Protocol on protection and welfare of animals", the Amsterdam Treaty lays down new rules for EU action in this area. It recognises that animals are sentient beings and obliges the European institutions to pay full regard to the welfare requirements of animals when formulating and implementing Community policies.<BR><BR>Community legislation in the field of animal welfare aims to save animals from any unnecessary suffering in three main areas: farming, transport and slaughter. As part of a comprehensive strategy on food safety, other Community policies (agriculture, transport, internal market and research) are also required to take account of this necessity.<BR><BR>In cooperation with the competent authorities of the Member States, the Food and Veterinary Office (FVO) carries out on-the-spot checks to ensure compliance with Community legislation.<BR><BR>See:<BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Common agricultural policy (CAP)">Common agricultural policy (CAP)</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Food safety">Food safety</A><BR><BR>
Applicant countries	Europe's economic and political stability is a magnet for many European countries, which have the right to apply to become members of the European Union (Article 49).<BR><BR>The countries that have applied are:<BR><BR>•Turkey: application received on 14 April 1987; <BR>•Cyprus: 3 July 1990; <BR>•Malta: 16 July 1990; <BR>•Hungary: 31 March 1994; <BR>•Poland: 5 April 1994; <BR>•Romania: 22 June 1995; <BR>•Slovakia: 27 June 1995; <BR>•Latvia: 13 October 1995; <BR>•Estonia: 24 November 1995; <BR>•Lithuania: 8 December 1995; <BR>•Bulgaria: 14 December 1995; <BR>•Czech Republic: 17 January 1996; <BR>•Slovenia: 10 June 1996. <BR><BR>At the Copenhagen European Council (12 and 13 December 2002), the Commission concluded negotiations with 10 applicant countries - Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia - thus enabling them to join the Union on 1 May 2004. As far as Bulgaria and Romania are concerned, the goal is to enable them to join by 2007. It may be possible to open negotiations with Turkey in December 2004 if it has fulfilled the Copenhagen criteria.<BR><BR>For the record, Switzerland, Liechtenstein and Norway have also all applied for membership of the European Union at various times. However, Norway twice rejected accession following referenda in 1972 and 1994, while the applications by Switzerland and Liechtenstein were shelved after Switzerland decided by a referendum in 1992 not to join the European Economic Area.<BR><BR>See:<BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Accession criteria">Accession criteria</A> (Copenhagen criteria)<BR>•<A HREF="bword://Accession negotiations">Accession negotiations</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Accession partnership">Accession partnership</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Community acquis">Community acquis</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Enlargement">Enlargement</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://European Conference">European Conference</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Incorporation of the Community acquis">Incorporation of the Community acquis</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Pre-accession aid">Pre-accession aid</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Pre-accession strategy">Pre-accession strategy</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Programme of Community aid to the countries of Central and Eastern Europe (Phare)">Programme of Community aid to the countries of Central and Eastern Europe (Phare)</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Screening">Screening</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://TAIEX (Technical Assistance Information Exchange Office)">TAIEX (Technical Assistance Information Exchange Office)</A><BR><BR>
Architecture of Europe	This refers to the various organisations, institutions, treaties and traditional relations making up the European area within which members work together on problems of shared interest.<BR><BR>An essential part of this architecture was established by the Treaty on European Union, which formed three pillars: the European Community (first pillar), the common foreign and security policy (second pillar) and cooperation in the fields of justice and home affairs (third pillar). Matters falling within the second and third pillars are handled by the Community institutions (the European Council, the Council, the Commission, the European Parliament etc.), but intergovernmental procedures apply.<BR><BR>See:<BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Common foreign and security policy (CFSP)">Common foreign and security policy (CFSP)</A> <BR>•<A HREF="bword://Justice and home affairs (JHA)">Justice and home affairs (JHA)</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Pillars of the European Union">Pillars of the European Union</A> <BR>•<A HREF="bword://Single institutional framework">Single institutional framework</A> <BR><BR>
Area of freedom, security and justice|area of freedom security and justice	The progress made since 1993 as a result of cooperation in the fields of justice and home affairs led to more ambitious objectives being enshrined in the Treaty of Amsterdam. It was decided to establish an area of freedom, security and justice, the aim being to ensure genuine freedom of movement for individuals on the territory of the European Union and more effective action against organised crime and fraud.<BR><BR>Matters relating to justice and home affairs used to be dealt with solely under the intergovernmental rules laid down in Title VI of the EU Treaty (the "third pillar"). With the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam, these fields have been divided up between the first and third pillars.<BR><BR>Under the first pillar, which is governed by the Community method, a new Title IV has been added to the EC Treaty ("Visas, asylum, immigration and other policies related to free movement of persons"). Meanwhile the new Title VI of the EU Treaty now covers fewer fields, but its objectives are spelled out more clearly, namely to establish close cooperation between police services, customs and judicial authorities.<BR><BR>The third pillar provisions still include a "bridge" allowing Member States to transfer areas of competence from Title VI to Title IV. The transfer procedure is very complex and has never been applied, but its existence suggests that in time all areas concerning justice and home affairs may be brought within the Community framework.<BR><BR>If some Member States wish to advance more quickly in certain fields and establish closer cooperation, they may do so within the European Union as specified in the new Article 40 of Title VI, without creating a separate legal system as happened with Schengen.<BR><BR>See:<BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Closer cooperation">Closer cooperation</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Communitisation">Communitisation</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Community 'bridge' (Title VI of the EU Treaty)">Community 'bridge' (Title VI of the EU Treaty)</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Europol (European Police Office)">Europol (European Police Office)</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Free movement of persons">Free movement of persons</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Justice and home affairs (JHA)">Justice and home affairs (JHA)</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Pillars of the European Union">Pillars of the European Union</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters">Police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Schengen">Schengen</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Single institutional framework">Single institutional framework</A><BR><BR>
Article 36 Committee of the EU Treaty	A Coordinating Committee consisting of senior officials was set up under Article 36 (former Article K.4) of the EU Treaty to prepare the ground for Council deliberations on police cooperation and judicial cooperation in civil matters. In practice the committee had already been in existence since the Rhodes European Council in December 1988.<BR><BR>See:<BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Justice and home affairs (JHA)">Justice and home affairs (JHA)</A><BR><BR>
Assent procedure	The assent procedure was introduced by the Single European Act.<BR><BR>It requires the Council to obtain Parliament's assent before certain important decisions are taken. The European Parliament may accept or reject a proposal but cannot amend it. If the European Parliament does not give its assent, the act in question cannot be adopted.<BR><BR>The assent procedure mainly applies to the accession of new Member States (Article 49 of the EU Treaty), association agreements and other fundamental agreements with third countries (Article 300 of the EC Treaty), and the appointment of the President of the Commission.<BR><BR>It is also required with regard to citizenship issues, the specific tasks of the European Central Bank (ECB), amendments to the Statutes of the European System of Central Banks and the ECB, the Structural and Cohesion Funds, and the uniform procedure for elections to the European Parliament.<BR><BR>Since entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam, the Parliament's assent has also been required for sanctions imposed on a Member State for a serious and persistent breach of fundamental rights under the new Article 7 of the EU Treaty. The Treaty of Nice has made the Parliament's assent mandatory where reinforced cooperation between certain Member States is envisaged in an area which is subject to the codecision procedure.<BR><BR>The European Convention established by the Laeken Declaration in December 2001 has been asked to propose simplifications to the procedures for the adoption of the various types of Community act and is therefore considering the future use of the assent procedure.<BR><BR>See:<BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Codecision procedure">Codecision procedure</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Consultation procedure">Consultation procedure</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Council of the European Union">Council of the European Union</A> <BR>•<A HREF="bword://European Commission">European Commission</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://European Parliament">European Parliament</A> <BR><BR>
Audiovisual	The Community's audiovisual policy must respect various - sometimes contradictory - interests and priorities, such as competition rules (especially regarding State aid), the rules on intellectual property and the principles of public service. The European audiovisual market is also facing a number of problems, including:<BR><BR>•the language barriers preventing free movement of programmes;<BR>•an unwieldy decision-making process which generally requires unanimity;<BR>•the need to make considerable investment to anticipate technological developments, which requires international alliances and/or mergers.<BR><BR>The Community's activity in the audiovisual field has developed in two broad directions:<BR><BR>•on the industrial front, a directive was adopted in 1986 to ensure the standardisation of the systems used in the Member States to broadcast programmes by satellite and cable. In 1989, objectives were defined for the development of high-definition television. Then, in 1991, a single standard for high-definition television production and financial support for a programme of cooperation between the businesses concerned were introduced. An action plan to promote the 16/9 format was adopted in 1993;<BR>•on the legal front, the Television without Frontiers Directive, adopted in 1989 and amended in 1997, provided a harmonised framework to promote the free movement, production and distribution of European television programmes. Common rules on advertising, sponsorship, protection of minors and the right of reply were introduced. The Directive also introduced distribution quotas, thus requiring TV channels to reserve, whenever possible, more than half their transmission time for European works.<BR><BR>Furthermore, since 1991, the Community MEDIA programme (measures to promote the development of the audiovisual industry) has been supporting the European audiovisual industry by encouraging the development and distribution of European works. It also finances schemes to improve the training of professionals in the sector.<BR><BR>The MEDIA Plus Programme (2000-2005), which follows on from MEDIA II (1996-2000), has a budget of EUR 4 million.<BR><BR>The Treaty of Amsterdam, adopted in June 1997, added a protocol on the public broadcasting system to the EC Treaty. The role of the Member States as regards public channels is made clear: they may continue to finance public service broadcasting, as long as the broadcasting organisation fulfils a public service remit and its funding does not unfairly affect either trade or competition in the sector.<BR><BR>See:<BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Competition">Competition</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Public service">Public service</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Television without frontiers">Television without frontiers</A>
Bilateral Intergovernmental Conference (EU-Applicant countries)|Bilateral Intergovernmental Conference|EU-Applicant countries	Negotiations on the accession of new Member States to the European Union take the form of bilateral intergovernmental conferences between the European Union and each of the applicant countries.<BR><BR>The intergovernmental conferences on the accession of the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Poland, Slovenia and Cyprus were formally opened on 30 March 1998. The first ministerial meeting to negotiate with these six applicants took place on 10 November 1998. The conferences on the accession of Bulgaria, Latvia, Lithuania, and Malta were opened on 15 February 2000.<BR><BR>See:<BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Accession of new Member States of the European Union">Accession of new Member States of the European Union</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Applicant countries">Applicant countries</A><BR><BR>
Budget	All the Union's revenue and expenditure is entered in the Community budget on the basis of the annual forecasts. The operational expenditure involved in implementing Titles V and VI of the EU Treaty may, however, constitute an exception to this rule by being charged to the Member States. In 1998 the Community budget totalled EUR 91 billion in commitment appropriations.<BR><BR>The Community budget is based on several principles, including:<BR><BR>•unity (all the revenue and expenditure is brought together in a single document);<BR>•annuality (budget operations relate to a given budget year);<BR>•equilibrium (expenditure must not exceed revenue).<BR><BR>The Commission is responsible for submitting a preliminary draft budget to the Council, which shares budgetary authority with the European Parliament. The nature of the expenditure determines which of the two institutions has the final say, depending on whether the expenditure is compulsory or not. However, quite apart from the classification of expenditure and the ensuing power-sharing, it should be remembered that it is the European Parliament that finally adopts or rejects the budget in its entirety.<BR><BR>Since 1993, the budget has been the subject of an interinstitutional agreement between Parliament, the Council and the Commission on budgetary discipline and improving the budgetary procedure. In 1998, the Commission presented a plan to renew the 1993 interinstitutional agreement in the light of experience gained in implementing it and to consolidate all the joint declarations and interinstitutional agreements on the budget concluded since 1982.<BR><BR>As part of the reforms proposed by the Commission in July 1997 in 'Agenda 2000', a new financial perspective will be adopted by the Member States to define the growth of the budget between 2000 and 2006.<BR><BR>See:<BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Classification of expenditure">Classification of expenditure</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://European Court of Auditors">European Court of Auditors</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Financial perspective 2000-2006">Financial perspective 2000-2006</A>
COREU (CORespondance EUropéenne)|COREU|CORespondance EUropéenne	Coreu is an EU communication network between the Member States and the Commission for cooperation in the fields of foreign policy. It makes it easier for decisions to be taken swiftly in emergencies.<BR><BR>See:<BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Common foreign and security policy (CFSP)">Common foreign and security policy (CFSP)</A> <BR><BR>
Charter of Fundamental Rights	Following the 50th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in December 1998, the Cologne European Council (3 and 4 June 1999) decided to begin work on drafting a charter of fundamental rights. The aim was that the fundamental rights applicable at Union level should be consolidated in a single document to raise awareness of them. The Charter is based on the Community Treaties, international conventions such as the 1950 European Convention on Human Rights and the 1989 European Social Charter, constitutional traditions common to the Member States and various European Parliament declarations.<BR><BR>The work was entrusted to a special body - which decided to call itself the Convention - made up of sixty-two members including representatives of the governments of the Member States and of the President of the European Commission, and members of the European Parliament and national parliaments. Four representatives of the Court of Justice of the European Union, the Council of Europe and the European Court of Human Rights were able to participate as observers. The composition, working methods and practical arrangements of the Convention were adopted at the Tampere European Council (15-16 October 1999).<BR><BR>Work began on 17 December 1999. The Economic and Social Committee, the Committee of the Regions, the Ombudsman, the applicant countries and any other any other body, social group or expert were invited to put forward their views. The objective was to reach a consensus. The result of the work was presented at the Biarritz European Council (13-14 October 2000). In its seven chapters divided into 54 articles, the Charter defines fundamental rights relating to dignity, liberty, equality, solidarity, citizenship and justice. It was solemnly proclaimed by the Nice European Council (7-10 December 2000).<BR><BR>The Intergovernmental Conference (IGC) which was concluded at the same European Council was unable to reach agreement on incorporating the Charter in the treaties and thus making it legally binding. However, the Court of Justice of the European Union stated that it wished to use the Charter as a guide in making its judgments. The Laeken European Council gave the European Convention a mandate to look into the question of incorporating the Charter into the existing treaties.<BR><BR>See:<BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Citizenship of the Union">Citizenship of the Union</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Equal opportunities">Equal opportunities</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Equal treatment for men and women">Equal treatment for men and women</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://European Convention">European Convention</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR)">European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR)</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Human rights">Human rights</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Laeken Declaration">Laeken Declaration</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Social Charter">Social Charter</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Treaty of Nice">Treaty of Nice</A><BR><BR>
Citizenship of the Union	Citizenship of the Union is dependent on holding the nationality of one of the Member States. In other words, anyone who is a national of a Member State is considered to be a citizen of the Union. In addition to the rights and duties laid down in the Treaty establishing the European Community, Union citizenship confers four special rights:<BR><BR>•freedom to move and take up residence anywhere in the Union;<BR>•the right to vote and stand in local government and European Parliament elections in the country of residence;<BR>•diplomatic and consular protection from the authorities of any Member State where the country of which a person is a national is not represented in a non-Union country;<BR>•the right of petition and appeal to the European Ombudsman.<BR><BR>The introduction of the notion of Union citizenship does not, of course, replace national citizenship: it is in addition to it. This gives the ordinary citizen a deeper and more tangible sense of belonging to the Union.<BR><BR>See:<BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Ombudsman">Ombudsman</A> <BR>•<A HREF="bword://Petitions">Petitions</A><BR><BR>
Clarity of the Treaties (simplification of the Treaties)|Clarity of the Treaties|simplification of the Treaties	The European Union has come into being gradually and its structure is the result of a succession of amendments to the various treaties. This has led to a situation where the lack of clarity and readability of the founding texts of the Union has created a gulf between the Union and the public. <BR><BR>The Treaty of Rome was followed by the Single European Act and the Treaty on European Union (the "Maastricht Treaty"). This Treaty created a new structure, the European Union, in addition to the European Communities, which has three pillars (the European Communities, common foreign and security policy and cooperation in the field of justice and home affairs). The Nice and Amsterdam Treaties contain amendments to the earlier treaties and a new article numbering system. Several protocols and declarations are also annexed to these treaties.<BR><BR>To make the treaties more accessible to the public, the December 2001 Laeken Declaration convened the European Convention to prepare for the reform of the European institutions and to consolidate the treaties.<BR><BR>As regards the simplification of the treaties, the Declaration asks the following questions:<BR><BR>•reorganisation of the treaties: should a distinction be made between a basic treaty and the other treaty provisions?<BR>•simplification: Should the distinction between the Union and the Communities be reviewed? What of the division into three pillars?<BR>•constitution: should a constitutional text be drafted?<BR>•what status should the Charter of Fundamental Rights have?<BR><BR>In October 2002, the President of the Convention proposed a preliminary draft constitutional treaty in three parts, the first dealing with the institutional architecture, the second with the policies and action of the Union and the third with transitional and final provisions and those on legal continuity proper to this kind of constitutional act. The Convention will present the results of its deliberations by June 2003.<BR><BR>See:<BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Charter of Fundamental Rights">Charter of Fundamental Rights</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Debate on the future of the European Union">Debate on the future of the European Union</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Democratic deficit">Democratic deficit</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://European Convention">European Convention</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Laeken Declaration">Laeken Declaration</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Simplification of legislation">Simplification of legislation</A> <BR>•<A HREF="bword://Transparency (access to documents)">Transparency (access to documents)</A><BR><BR>
Classification of expenditure	This refers to the distinction made between Union expenditure of which the underlying principle and the amount are legally determined by the treaties, secondary legislation, conventions, international treaties or private contracts ("compulsory" expenditure) and expenditure for which the budgetary authority is free to decide the amount as it sees fit ("non-compulsory" expenditure). The question of whether expenditure is to be considered compulsory or non-compulsory generates friction between the two arms of the budgetary authority - the Council and the European Parliament - as Parliament has the final say in determining the amount of expenditure only where it is non-compulsory. As agricultural expenditure is considered compulsory, the result is that more than 45% of the Community budget is outside Parliament's control.<BR><BR>See:<BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Budget">Budget</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Common agricultural policy (CAP)">Common agricultural policy (CAP)</A> <BR>•<A HREF="bword://Consultation procedure">Consultation procedure</A> <BR>•<A HREF="bword://Council of the European Union">Council of the European Union</A> <BR>•<A HREF="bword://European Parliament">European Parliament</A> <BR><BR>
Closer cooperation	To encourage closer cooperation between countries of the European Union who wish to go further than the degree of integration provided for by the Treaties (in the fields of social affairs, elimination of border controls, etc.), various instruments have been introduced, such as the Social Policy Agreement and the Schengen Accords. This has allowed Member States who so wish to make progress at a different pace or on different objectives outside the institutional framework of the European Union.<BR><BR>After the Treaty of Amsterdam came into force, the use of these instruments was put on a more formal footing with the introduction of the concept of "closer cooperation" in the Treaty on European Union (EU Treaty) and the Treaty establishing the European Community (EC Treaty).<BR><BR>The aim of such cooperation is to enable a limited number of Member States that are willing and able to advance further to deepen European integration within the single institutional framework of the Union.<BR><BR>Closer cooperation must meet a number of conditions. In particular it must:<BR><BR>•cover an area which does not fall within the exclusive competence of the Community; <BR>•be aimed at furthering the objectives of the Union; <BR>•respect the principles of the Treaties and the Community <I>acquis</I>; <BR>•be used only as a last resort; <BR>•involve a minimum number of Member States;<BR>•allow the gradual integration of other Member States.<BR><BR>Closer cooperation under the EC Treaty is authorised by the Council, acting by a qualified majority on a proposal from the Commission and after consulting the European Parliament.<BR><BR>The object of closer cooperation under the EU Treaty, according to the provisions of the Treaty of Amsterdam, is to develop the area of freedom, security and justice. At the request of the Member States concerned, it is authorised by the Council, acting by a qualified majority after obtaining the Commission's opinion and after submitting the request to the European Parliament.<BR><BR>According to the Treaty of Amsterdam, a Member State could always refuse to allow closer cooperation in a particular area for reasons of national political importance. However, a qualified majority in the Council could refer the matter to the European Council, which must act unanimously.<BR><BR>The Treaty of Nice aimed, in particular, to simplify the use of closer cooperation and introduced significant changes:<BR><BR>•the minimum number of Member States required for closer cooperation has been cut by a half (Treaty of Amsterdam) to eight, irrespective of the total number of Member States;<BR>•Member States can no longer prevent closer cooperation: the matter may be referred to the European Council but it is the Council of Ministers that decides by the majority provided for in the Treaties;<BR>•under the EC Treaty, Parliament's assent is required if closer cooperation covers a field subject to codecision; <BR>•an additional condition for the implementation of closer cooperation has been added: it must not jeopardise the internal market or economic and social cohesion.<BR><BR>The Treaty of Nice introduced the possibility of closer cooperation in the field of the common foreign and security policy (CFSP), except for matters having military or defence implications. At procedural level, decisions are taken by the Council, after an opinion from the Commission, acting by qualified majority on the basis of a common strategy.<BR><BR>See:<BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Concentric circles">Concentric circles</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Europe 'à la carte'">Europe 'à la carte'</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Intergovernmental Conference (IGC)">Intergovernmental Conference (IGC)</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://'Multi-speed' Europe">'Multi-speed' Europe</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Single institutional framework">Single institutional framework</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Treaty of Nice">Treaty of Nice</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://'Variable-geometry' Europe">'Variable-geometry' Europe</A><BR><BR>
Codecision procedure	The codecision procedure (Article 251 of the EC Treaty, formerly Article 189b) was introduced by the Treaty of Maastricht. It gives the European Parliament the power to adopt instruments jointly with the Council. The procedure comprises one, two or three readings. It has the effect of increasing contacts between the Parliament and the Council, the co-legislators, and with the European Commission. In practice, it has strengthened the Parliament's legislative powers in the following fields: the free movement of workers, right of establishment, services, the internal market, education (incentive measures), health (incentive measures), consumer policy, trans-European networks (guidelines), environment (general action programme), culture (incentive measures) and research (framework programme).<BR><BR>The Treaty of Amsterdam has simplified the codecision procedure, making it quicker and more effective and strengthening the role of the Parliament. In addition it has been extended to new areas such as social exclusion, public health and the fight against fraud affecting the European Community's financial interests.<BR><BR>Increasing the democratic nature of Community action requires the Parliament to participate in exercising legislative power. Thus, any legislative instrument adopted by qualified majority is likely to fall within the scope of the codecision procedure. In most cases, therefore, codecision in the Parliament goes hand in hand with qualified majority voting in the Council. For some provisions of the Treaty, however, codecision and unanimity still coexist.<BR><BR>The Treaty of Nice partially puts an end to this situation. The Intergovernmental Conference (IGC) launched in February 2000 called for an extension of the scope of codecision, in parallel with and as a supplement to the extension of qualified majority voting in the Council. Seven provisions for which the IGC planned to apply qualified majority voting are thus also subject to codecision. They are: incentives to combat discrimination, judicial cooperation in civil matters, specific industrial support measures, economic and social cohesion actions (outside the Structural Funds), the statute for European political parties and measures relating to visas, asylum and immigration. On the other hand, the IGC did not extend the codecision procedure to legislative measures already subject to qualified majority voting (such as agricultural or commercial policy). There is therefore no definitive link yet between qualified majority voting and the codecision procedure for all legislative decisions.<BR><BR>See:<BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Conciliation Committee">Conciliation Committee</A> <BR>•<A HREF="bword://Council of the European Union ">Council of the European Union </A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://European Parliament">European Parliament</A> <BR>•<A HREF="bword://Qualified majority">Qualified majority</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Treaty of Nice">Treaty of Nice</A><BR><BR>
Collective defence	Collective defence refers to participation in the defence of Europe under the Treaties of Brussels (Article V) and Washington (Article 5), which stipulate that in the event of aggression, the signatory states are required to provide assistance for the restoration of security.<BR><BR>Since 1949, NATO has been the principal guarantor of security in western Europe, whereas the Western European Union (WEU) has simply been ticking over for nearly 30 years. It should be noted, however, that the WEU is the only strictly European organisation to have established an automatic collective defence obligation. The development of a European security and defence identity in no way affects the principle that NATO continues to form the basis of Europe's collective defence.<BR><BR>See:<BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP)">Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP)</A> <BR>•<A HREF="bword://Eurocorps">Eurocorps</A> <BR>•<A HREF="bword://EUROFOR/EUROMARFOR">EUROFOR/EUROMARFOR</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://European Security and Defence Policy (ESDP)">European Security and Defence Policy (ESDP)</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://NATO">NATO</A> <BR>•<A HREF="bword://'New look' NATO">'New look' NATO</A> <BR>•<A HREF="bword://Western European Union (WEU)">Western European Union (WEU)</A> <BR><BR>
Comitology	Under the Treaty establishing the European Community, it is for the Commission to implement legislation at Community level (Article 202 of the EC Treaty, ex-Article 145). In practice, each legislative instrument specifies the scope of the implementing powers granted to the Commission and how the Commission is to use them. Frequently, the instrument will also make provision for the Commission to be assisted by a committee in accordance with a procedure known as "comitology". <BR><BR>The committees which are forums for discussion, consist of representatives from Member States and are chaired by the Commission. They enable the Commission to establish a dialogue with national administrations before adopting implementing measures. The Commission ensures that they reflect as far as possible the situation in each country in question.<BR><BR>Procedures which govern relations between the Commission and the committees are based on models set out in a Council Decision ("comitology" Decision). The first "comitology" Decision dates back to 13 July 1987. In order to take into account the changes in the Treaty - and, in particular, Parliament's new position under the codecision procedure - but also to reply to criticisms that the Community system is too complex and too opaque, the 1987 Decision has been replaced by the Council Decision of 28 June 1999. <BR><BR>The new Decision ensures that Parliament can keep a eye on the implementation of legislative instruments adopted under the codesision procedure. In cases where legislation comes under this procedure, Parliament can express its disapproval of measures proposed by the Commission or, where appropriate, by the Council, which, in Parliament's opinion, go beyond the implementing powers provided for in the legislation. <BR><BR>The Decision clarifies the criteria to be applied to the choice of committee and simplifies the operational procedures. Committees base their opinions on the draft implementing measures prepared by the Commission. The committees can be divided into the following categories:<BR><BR>•advisory committees: they give their opinions to the Commission which must take the utmost account of them. This straightforward procedure is generally used when the matters under discussion are not very sensitive politically. <BR>•management committees: where the measures adopted by the Commission are not consistent with the committee's opinion (delivered by qualified majority), the Commission must communicate them to the Council which, acting by a qualified majority, can take a different decision. This procedure is used in particular for measures relating to the management of the common agricultural policy, fisheries, and the main Community programmes.<BR>•regulatory committees: the Commission can only adopt implementing measures if it obtains the approval by qualified majority of the Member States meeting within the committee. In the absence of such support, the proposed measure is referred back to the Council which takes a decision by qualified majority. However, if the Council does not take a decision, the Commission finally adopts the implementing measure provided that the Council does not object by a qualified majority. This procedure is used for measures relating to protection of the health or safety of persons, animals and plants and measures amending non-essential provisions of the basic legislative instruments. <BR><BR>It also provides the criteria which, depending on the matter under discussion, will guide the legislative authority in its choice of committee procedure for the item of legislation; this is meant to facilitate the adoption of the legislation under the codecision procedure.<BR><BR>Lastly, several innovations in the new "comitology" Decision enhance the transparency of the committee system to the benefit of Parliament and the general public: committee documents will be more readily accessible to the citizen (the arrangements are the same as those applying to Commission documents). Committee documents will also be registered in a public register which will be available from 2001 onwards. The ultimate aim is, with the computerisation of decision-making procedures, to publish the full texts of non-confidential documents transmitted to Parliament on the Internet. From 2000 onwards, the Commission will publish an annual report giving a summary of committee activities during the previous year. <BR><BR>See:<BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Codecision procedure">Codecision procedure</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Committees and working parties">Committees and working parties</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Council of the European Union ">Council of the European Union </A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://European Commission">European Commission</A><BR><BR>
Committee of the Regions (CoR)|CoR|Committee of the Regions	Created by the Maastricht Treaty in 1992, the Committee of the Regions consists of 222 representatives of local and regional authorities appointed by the Council for four years on the basis of unanimous proposals from the Member States. It is consulted by the Council, Parliament and the Commission in areas affecting local and regional interests, such as education, youth, culture, health and social and economic cohesion.<BR><BR>It may also issue opinions on its own initiative.<BR><BR>Following the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam (May 1999), the Committee has to be consulted on an even wider range of fields - the environment, the Social Fund, vocational training, cross-border cooperation and transport.<BR><BR>The Treaty of Nice (adopted in December 2000) did not change either the number or the distribution of seats by Member State in the CoR. With a view to enlargement, the Treaty stipulates that, in future, the number of its members may not exceed 350. As regards eligibility for membership, the Treaty provides explicitly that members must hold a regional or local authority electoral mandate or be politically accountable to an elected assembly. <BR><BR>See:<BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Subsidiarity">Subsidiarity</A><BR><BR>
Committees and working parties	The committees, whose task it is to assist the Community institutions, are involved at all stages of the legislative process. The Commission regularly consults committees of experts before drawing up a new proposal for legislation. These committees, which are made up of representatives of the milieux involved, private sector or national government experts, ensure that the Commission remains open to the concerns of those who will be affected by the legislation. There are about 60 advisory committees covering all sectors, though about half of them deal with agricultural issues.<BR><BR>In the European Parliament, various permanent committees organise the work of the MEPs.<BR><BR>The Council is also assisted by committees and working parties which prepare its decisions. The existence of certain committees is provided for in the treaties (Article 36 Committee for justice and home affairs, for example), and others are ad hoc committees such as the Cultural Affairs Committee, which evaluates proposals on cultural cooperation, prepares the Council discussions and follows up action taken. These committees are made up of representatives of the Member States plus one member of the Commission. In parallel, various working parties do the preparatory work for Coreper. While some of them are set up on a temporary basis to deal with a particular dossier, about a hundred groups cover a given sector and meet regularly. <BR><BR>When a legislative text has been adopted, it lays down the general principles to be respected. More precise implementing measures may be necessary to apply these principles. In this case, the text provides that a committee is to be set up within the Commission in order to take the appropriate decisions. These committees are made up of experts nominated by the Member States and chaired by the Commission, and are generally governed by rules established by the 1987 Council decision known as the 'Comitology Decision'. There are about 300 of them, in the fields of industry, social affairs, agriculture, the environment, the internal market, research and development, consumer protection and food safety. <BR><BR>See:<BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Article 36 Committee of the EU Treaty">Article 36 Committee of the EU Treaty</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Comitology">Comitology</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Coreper">Coreper</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Parliamentary Committees">Parliamentary Committees</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Political and Security Committee (PSC)">Political and Security Committee (PSC)</A><BR><BR>
Common agricultural policy (CAP)|CAP|Common agricultural policy	The common agricultural policy is a matter reserved exclusively for the Community. Under Article 33 of the EC Treaty (former Article 39), its aims are to ensure reasonable prices for Europe's consumers and fair incomes for farmers, in particular by establishing common agricultural market organisations and by applying the principles of single prices, financial solidarity and Community preference.<BR><BR>The CAP is one of the most important Union policies (agricultural expenditure accounts for some 45% of the Community budget). Policy is decided by qualified majority vote in the Council after consultation of the European Parliament.<BR><BR>At the outset the CAP enabled the Community to become self-sufficient in a very short time. However, it came to be increasingly costly because European prices were too high by comparison with world market prices. A series of reforms in 1992 corrected the situation by cutting guaranteed farm prices, with compensatory premiums for inputs, and by introducing a series of "flanking measures".<BR><BR>With a view to enlargement a new reform package was adopted in 1999 for the period 2000-2006. Under the approach proposed by the Commission in Agenda 2000 in July 1997, it reinforces the changes made in 1992 and puts the emphasis on food safety, environmental objectives and sustainable agriculture. Moreover, it endeavours to increase the competitiveness of Community agricultural products, simplify agricultural legislation and how it is implemented and strengthen the Union's position at the World Trade Organisation negotiations (Millennium Round), and lastly stabilise agriculture expenditure.<BR><BR>In this spirit, changes have already been made in the common organisation of the market in wine, arable crops, beef and veal and milk. The proposed reduction in intervention prices has been off-set by an increase in aid to farmers and accompanied by a genuine integrated rural development policy.<BR><BR>See:<BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Agenda 2000">Agenda 2000</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Animal welfare">Animal welfare</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Common organisation of agricultural markets (COM)">Common organisation of agricultural markets (COM)</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Environment">Environment</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Food safety">Food safety</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Rural development">Rural development</A><BR><BR>
Common commercial policy	The Community has exclusive responsibility for the common commercial policy (Article 133 of the EC Treaty, formerly Article 113). Under the policy a customs union has been established between the Member States of the Community, with uniform principles governing changes in tariff rates, the conclusion of tariff and trade agreements with non-member countries, import and export policy, etc. Decisions are taken by qualified majority in the Council.<BR><BR>The Treaty of Amsterdam amended Article 113 to allow the Council, acting by unanimous vote, to extend the scope of the common commercial policy to international negotiations and agreements on services and intellectual property. The Treaty of Nice also amended Article 113 to allow such agreements to be concluded by qualified majority voting. There are, however, exceptions concerning agreements in sectors for which responsibility is shared between the Member States and the Community, which remain subject to unanimity. Such exceptions include trade in cultural and audiovisual services and trade in education services.<BR><BR>See:<BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Council of the European Union">Council of the European Union</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Customs Union">Customs Union</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://External responsibilities of the European Community">External responsibilities of the European Community</A> <BR>•<A HREF="bword://Qualified majority">Qualified majority</A> <BR>•<A HREF="bword://Treaty of Nice">Treaty of Nice</A><BR><BR>
Common foreign and security policy (CFSP)|CFSP|Common foreign and security policy	The common foreign and security policy (CFSP) was established and is governed by Title V of the Treaty on European Union. It replaced European Political Cooperation (EPC) and provides for the eventual framing of a common defence policy which might in time lead to a common defence.<BR><BR>The objectives of this second pillar of the Union are set out in Article 11 of the EU Treaty and are to be attained through specific legal instruments (joint action, common position) which have to be adopted unanimously in the Council. With the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam, the European Union also has a new instrument at its disposal - the common strategy - which is referred to in the Article 12 of the EU Treaty. The Treaty of Amsterdam also provided for qualified majority voting under certain conditions and since it was signed the CFSP has been developing in practice at every European Council.<BR><BR>The Treaty of Nice introduced the possibility, under certain conditions, of establishing closer cooperation in the field of the CFSP for the implementation of joint actions and common positions. This closer cooperation may not be used for matters with military or defence implications.<BR><BR>See:<BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Abstention, constructive (positive abstention)">Abstention, constructive (positive abstention)</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Common position (CFSP)">Common position (CFSP)</A> <BR>•<A HREF="bword://Common strategy (CFSP)">Common strategy (CFSP)</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Coreu (CORrespondance EUropeenne)">Coreu (CORrespondance EUropeenne)</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Declaration (CFSP)">Declaration (CFSP)</A> <BR>•<A HREF="bword://Joint action (CFSP)">Joint action (CFSP)</A> <BR>•<A HREF="bword://NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organisation)">NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organisation)</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Pillars of the European Union">Pillars of the European Union</A> <BR>•<A HREF="bword://Planning and Early Warning Unit">Planning and Early Warning Unit</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Political and Security Committee (PSC)">Political and Security Committee (PSC)</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Single institutional framework">Single institutional framework</A> <BR>•<A HREF="bword://Title V of the EU Treaty (CFSP)">Title V of the EU Treaty (CFSP)</A> <BR>•<A HREF="bword://Western European Union (WEU)">Western European Union (WEU)</A> <BR><BR>
Common organisations of the agricultural markets (COM)|COM|Common organisations of the agricultural markets	The common organisations of the market (COM) are provisions laid down at Community level which govern the production of and trade in agricultural products in all the Member States of the European Union. Since the introduction of the common agricultural policy (CAP), they have gradually replaced national market organisations in the sectors where that was necessary. The common organisations of the market seek primarily to achieve the goals of the CAP, and in particular to stabilise markets, provide farmers with a fair standard of living and increase agricultural productivity.<BR><BR>See:<BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Common agricultural policy (CAP)">Common agricultural policy (CAP)</A><BR><BR>
Common position (CFSP)|CFSP|Common position	The common position in the context of the common foreign and security policy is designed to make cooperation more systematic and improve its coordination.

Common strategy (CFSP)|CFSP|Common strategy	The common strategy is a new instrument introduced under the common foreign and security policy by the Treaty of Amsterdam.<BR><BR>Under the new Article 13 of the EU Treaty, the European Council defines the principles and general guidelines for the CFSP and decides on common strategies to be implemented by the Union in fields where the Member States have important interests in common.<BR><BR>In concrete terms, a common strategy sets out the aims and length of time covered and the means to be made available by the Union and the Member States. Common strategies are implemented by the Council, in particular by adopting joint actions and common positions. The Council can recommend common strategies to the European Council.<BR><BR>See:<BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Common foreign and security policy (CFSP)">Common foreign and security policy (CFSP)</A><BR><BR>
Common transport policy	The aim of the common transport policy is to lay down common rules applicable to international transport to or from the territory of the Member States or passing across the territory of one or more of them (Articles 70 to 80 of the EC Treaty). It is also concerned with laying down the conditions under which non-resident carriers may operate services within a Member State; and lastly, it covers measures to improve transport safety.<BR><BR>With the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam, decisions are now taken under the codecision procedure (Article 251 of the EC Treaty), after the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions have been consulted. However, some special cases still remain:<BR><BR>•measures that are liable to have a major impact on living standards, employment and the operation of transport facilities are adopted by the Council acting unanimously, after consulting the European Parliament and the Economic and Social Committee;<BR>•in the case of specific measures relating to sea and air transport, the Council decides what procedure to apply in each individual instance, acting by a qualified majority.<BR><BR>See:<BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Codecision procedure">Codecision procedure</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Consultation procedure">Consultation procedure</A> <BR>•<A HREF="bword://Cooperation procedure">Cooperation procedure</A> <BR>•<A HREF="bword://Qualified majority">Qualified majority</A> <BR>•<A HREF="bword://Trans-European networks (TEN)">Trans-European networks (TEN)</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Unanimity">Unanimity</A><BR><BR>
Communitisation	Communitisation means transferring a matter which, in the institutional framework of the Union, is dealt with using the intergovernmental method (second and third pillars) to the Community method (first pillar). <BR><BR>The Community method is based on the idea that the general interest of Union citizens is best defended when the Community institutions play their full role in the decision-making process, with due regard for the subsidiarity principle.<BR><BR>Following the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam, questions relating to the free movement of persons, which used to be come under cooperation on justice and home affairs (third pillar), have been "communitised" and so will be dealt with under the Community method after a five-year transitional phase.<BR><BR>See:<BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Area of freedom, security and justice">Area of freedom, security and justice</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Community 'bridge' (Title VI of the EU Treaty)">Community 'bridge' (Title VI of the EU Treaty)</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Community and intergovernmental methods">Community and intergovernmental methods</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Justice and home affairs (JHA)">Justice and home affairs (JHA)</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Pillars of the European Union">Pillars of the European Union</A><BR><BR>
Community 'bridge' (Title VI of the EU Treaty)|Community bridge|Title VI of the EU Treaty	The Treaty of Maastricht introduced the possibility of bringing some areas covered by Title VI of the EU Treaty under the Community framework (qualified majority voting, as provided for in the former Article 100c). This procedure, known as the "bridge", required unanimity in the Council and ratification by each Member State in accordance with its national constitutional requirements.<BR><BR>With the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam, any areas falling under the new Article 29 in Title VI may be transferred to the new Title IV of the EC Treaty. As in the past, any decision to bring such matters within the Community framework will have to be taken by the Council unanimously and ratified by each Member State.<BR><BR>See:<BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Area of freedom, security and justice">Area of freedom, security and justice</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Communitisation">Communitisation</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Justice and home affairs (JHA)">Justice and home affairs (JHA)</A><BR><BR>
Community acquis	The Community <I>acquis</I> is the body of common rights and obligations which bind all the Member States together within the European Union. It is constantly evolving and comprises:<BR><BR>•the content, principles and political objectives of the Treaties; <BR>•the legislation adopted in application of the treaties and the case law of the Court of Justice; <BR>•the declarations and resolutions adopted by the Union; <BR>•measures relating to the common foreign and security policy; <BR>•measures relating to justice and home affairs; <BR>•international agreements concluded by the Community and those concluded by the Member States between themselves in the field of the Union's activities. <BR><BR>Thus the Community <I>acquis</I> comprises not only Community law in the strict sense, but also all acts adopted under the second and third pillars of the European Union and the common objectives laid down in the Treaties. The Union has committed itself to maintaining the Community <I>acquis</I> in its entirety and developing it further. <BR><BR>Applicant countries have to accept the Community <I>acquis</I> before they can join the Union. Derogations from the <I>acquis</I> are granted only in exceptional circumstances and are limited in scope. <BR><BR>In preparation for the next enlargement, the applicant countries now need to transpose the <I>acquis</I> into their national legislation and will have to implement it from the moment of their accession.<BR><BR>See:<BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Applicant countries">Applicant countries</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Enlargement">Enlargement</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Incorporation of the Community acquis">Incorporation of the Community acquis</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Pillars of the European Union">Pillars of the European Union</A> <BR>•<A HREF="bword://Single institutional framework">Single institutional framework</A> <BR><BR>
Community and intergovernmental methods	The Community method is the expression used for the institutional operating mode set up in the first pillar of the European Union. It proceeds from an integration logic with due respect for the subsidiarity principle, and has the following salient features:<BR><BR>•Commission monopoly of the right of initiative;<BR>•widespread use of qualified majority voting in the Council;<BR>•an active role for the European Parliament;<BR>•uniform interpretation of Community law by the Court of Justice.<BR><BR>It contrasts with the intergovernmental method of operation used in the second and third pillars, which proceeds from an intergovernmental logic of cooperation and has the following salient features:<BR><BR>•the Commission's right of initiative is shared with the Member States or confined to specific areas of activity;<BR>•the Council generally acts unanimously;<BR>•the European Parliament has a purely consultative role;<BR>•the Court of Justice plays only a minor role.<BR><BR>See:<BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Community law">Community law</A> <BR>•<A HREF="bword://Court of Justice of the European Union">Court of Justice of the European Union</A> <BR>•<A HREF="bword://Governance">Governance</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Monitoring the application of Community law">Monitoring the application of Community law</A> <BR>•<A HREF="bword://Pillars of the European Union">Pillars of the European Union</A> <BR>•<A HREF="bword://Qualified majority">Qualified majority</A> <BR>•<A HREF="bword://Right of initiative">Right of initiative</A> <BR>•<A HREF="bword://Single institutional framework">Single institutional framework</A> <BR><BR>
Community law	Strictly speaking, Community law consists of the founding Treaties (primary legislation) and the provisions of instruments enacted by the Community institutions by virtue of them (secondary legislation).<BR><BR>In a broader sense, Community law encompasses all the rules of the Community legal order, including general principles of law, the case law of the Court of Justice, law flowing from the Community's external relations and supplementary law contained in conventions and similar agreements concluded between the Member States to give effect to Treaty provisions.<BR><BR>All these rules of law form part of what is known as the Community <I>acquis</I>.<BR><BR>See:<BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Monitoring the application of Community law">Monitoring the application of Community law</A> <BR><BR>
Community legal instruments	The term Community legal instruments refers to the instruments available to the Community institutions to carry out their tasks under the Treaty establishing the European Community with due respect for the subsidiarity principle. They are:<BR><BR>•regulations: these are binding in their entirety and directly applicable in all Member States;<BR>•directives: these bind the Member States as to the results to be achieved; they have to be transposed into the national legal framework and thus leave a margin for manoeuvre as to the form and means of implementation;<BR>•decisions: these are fully binding on those to whom they are addressed;<BR>•recommendations and opinions: these are non-binding, declaratory instruments.<BR><BR>See:<BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Hierarchy of Community acts (hierarchy of norms)">Hierarchy of Community acts (hierarchy of norms)</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Pillars of the European Union">Pillars of the European Union</A> <BR>•<A HREF="bword://Single institutional framework">Single institutional framework</A> <BR><BR>
Community powers	Community powers are those which are conferred on the Community in specific areas. The European Communities are thus able to act only within the framework of the Treaties.<BR><BR>There are three types of powers, which depend on the mode of attribution:<BR><BR>•Explicit powers: these are clearly defined in the Treaties.<BR>•Implicit powers: where the European Community has explicit powers in a particular area (e.g. transport), it also has a powers in the same field with regard to external relations (e.g. negotiation of international agreements).<BR>•Subsidiary powers: where the Community has no explicit or implicit powers to achieve a Treaty objective concerning the single market, Article 308 allows the Council, acting unanimously, to take the measures it considers necessary.<BR><BR>See:<BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Delimitation of competences">Delimitation of competences</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Subsidiarity">Subsidiarity</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Subsidiary powers">Subsidiary powers</A><BR><BR>
Competition	The rules on competition are intended to ensure that a European economic area based on market forces can function effectively. The European Community's competition policy (Articles 81 to 89 of the EC Treaty, formerly 85 to 94) is based on five main principles:<BR><BR>•the prohibition of concerted practices, agreements and associations between undertakings which may affect trade between Member States and prevent, restrict or distort competition within the common market;<BR>•the prohibition of abuse of a dominant position within the common market, in so far as it may affect trade between Member States;<BR>•supervision of aid granted by the Member States, or through State resources in whatever form whatsoever, which threatens to distort competition by favouring certain undertakings or the production of certain goods;<BR>•preventive supervision of mergers with a European dimension, by approving or prohibiting the envisaged alliances;<BR>•liberalisation of certain sectors where public or private enterprises have hitherto evolved monopolistically, such as telecommunications, transport or energy.<BR><BR>The first two principles may, however, be subject to derogations, particularly when an agreement between undertakings improves the production or distribution of products or promotes technical progress. In the case of state aid schemes, social subsidies, or subsidies to promote culture and conservation of heritage, are also examples of possible exceptions to the strict application of competition rules. <BR><BR>The difficulty of pursuing an effective competition policy lies in the fact that the Community must continually juggle aims that are sometimes contradictory, since it has to ensure that:<BR><BR>•the quest for perfect competition on the internal market does not make European businesses less competitive on the world market;<BR>•efforts to liberalise do not threaten the maintenance of public services meeting basic needs. <BR><BR>See:<BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Competitiveness">Competitiveness</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Concentration">Concentration</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Services of general economic interest">Services of general economic interest</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://State aid">State aid</A><BR><BR>
Competitiveness	The European Commission's 1994 White Paper on Growth, Competitiveness and Employment contains guidelines for a policy of global competitiveness. The policy encompasses four objectives which have lost none of their topicality today:<BR><BR>•helping European firms to adapt to the new globalised and interdependent competitive situation;<BR>•exploiting the competitive advantages associated with the gradual shift to a knowledge-based economy;<BR>•promoting a sustainable development of industry;<BR>•reducing the time-lag between the pace of change in supply and the corresponding adjustments in demand.<BR><BR>The new title on employment incorporated in the EC Treaty by the Treaty of Amsterdam takes account of the objectives set in the White Paper.<BR><BR>See:<BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Employment">Employment</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Enterprise policy">Enterprise policy</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Globalisation of the economy ">Globalisation of the economy </A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Sustainable development">Sustainable development</A><BR><BR>
Composition of the European Commission	The Commission currently comprises at least one national of each Member State (two for the large States: France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom). <BR><BR>The composition of the Commission in the light of enlargement is central to all the current debates. It is a key issue, since it involves deciding on the optimum number of Commissioners needed to guarantee the legitimacy, collective responsibility and efficiency of an institution whose purpose is to represent the general interest in complete independence. The concept of collective responsibility is crucial. It is specific to the Commission structure and means that positions adopted by the Commission reflect the views of the Commission as a whole, not those of individual members. With the prospect of future enlargements, there are fears that a large increase in the number of Commissioners will lead to nationalisation of their function to the detriment of collective responsibility. Conversely, should the number be limited, the fear is that some nationalities will not be represented within the Commission as such.<BR><BR>The Treaty of Nice, a product of the 2000 Intergovernmental Conference, offers a provisional solution to this question by providing for:<BR><BR>•a limit on the number of members from the date on which the next Commission takes up its duties (1 November 2004) to one per Member State;<BR>•a ceiling on the number of members once membership of the Union reaches 27; at that point the Council will have to decide, acting unanimously, the exact number of members the Commission will have (always fewer than 27); their nationality will then depend on a fair rotation system between Member States.<BR><BR>The Member States which until that point have had two Commission members will therefore lose, from 2005, the right to put forward a second Commissioner, but will obtain in return a re-weighting of the votes in their favour when decisions are adopted within the Council.<BR><BR>•The Copenhagen European Council (12-13 December 2002) decided that the Commissioners from the new Member States should take their place on the current Commission from the date of their country's accession, scheduled for 1 May 2004. <BR><BR>See:<BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Enlargement">Enlargement</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://European Commission">European Commission</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://President of the European Commission">President of the European Commission</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Weighting of votes in the Council">Weighting of votes in the Council</A><BR><BR>
Concentration	A concentration is the result of a merger between two or more previously independent enterprises, but may also be the result of the takeover of an enterprise by another enterprise acting alone (sole control) or by two or more enterprises acting jointly (joint control).<BR><BR>Under European competition law, concentrations with a Community dimension (i.e. exceeding the turnover thresholds laid down in the 1989 Merger Control Regulation) are subject to a control procedure which gives the Commission the power to assess their compatibility with the common market and, where appropriate, to prohibit them. Under that Regulation, a concentration with a Community dimension "which creates or strengthens a dominant position as a result of which effective competition would be significantly impeded in the common market or in a substantial part of it shall be declared incompatible with the common market." <BR><BR>With a view to determining the compatibility of a concentration with the common market, the Commission takes account on a case-by-case basis of several factors, such as the concepts of "Community dimension", "dominant position", "effective competition" and "relevant market".<BR><BR>See:<BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Competition">Competition</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Enterprise policy">Enterprise policy</A><BR><BR>
Concentric circles	This concept involves a Europe structured out of subsets of states which have achieved different levels of integration. It is not confined just to the integration structure of the European Union, and the idea has been expanded upon by a number of prominent figures. Some of them talk of "the circle of shared law" (the Union's Member States), the "adjacent circle" (the countries outside the Union waiting to join it) and "more select circles" for the purpose of greater cooperation (the currency circle, the defence circle and so on).<BR><BR>See:<BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Closer cooperation">Closer cooperation</A><BR><BR>
Conciliation Committee	Under the codecision procedure between Council and Parliament, a Conciliation Committee may be set up as provided for in Article 251(4) (former Article 189b(4)) of the EU Treaty. It comprises the members of the Council or their representatives and an equal number of representatives of Parliament. Any disagreement between the two institutions on the outcome of a codecision procedure is referred to the Committee with a view to reaching agreement on a text acceptable to both sides.<BR><BR>The draft of any joint text must then be adopted within six weeks by qualified majority in the Council and by an absolute majority of the members of Parliament. Should one of the two institutions reject the proposal, it is deemed not to have been adopted.<BR><BR>See: <BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Codecision procedure">Codecision procedure</A><BR><BR>
Confirmation of the European Commission	The Treaties of Maastricht and Amsterdam completely overhauled the procedure for appointing the Commission, introducing a confirmation procedure. <BR><BR>The procedure is in two stages. To begin with the governments of the Member States, by common accord, nominate the person they intend to appoint as President of the Commission. Their nominee is then approved by the European Parliament. The Member States nominate the other persons they intend to appoint as Members, in consultation with the President-designate. The entire Commission is then subject to a vote of approval by the European Parliament, after individual hearings by the appropriate Parliamentary committees, and is finally appointed by the representatives of Member State governments meeting in the Council.<BR><BR>The Treaty of Nice, which entered into force on 1 February 2003, introduced further changes to the procedure for appointing the Commission. <BR><BR>There are still two stages to the procedure, the first relating to the President, the second to the Commission as a whole, but the role of the European Council has been enhanced.<BR><BR>Responsibility for nominating the President now rests with the European Council, acting by qualified majority and after approval by Parliament. The Council, acting by qualified majority and by common accord with the nominee for President, then adopts the list of the other persons it intends to appoint as Members of the Commission. The list is drawn up in accordance with the proposals made by the Member States, which the President will consult before approving the names proposed.<BR><BR>Finally, the President and the Members of the Commission are appointed by the Council, acting by qualified majority, after the entire body has been approved by Parliament.<BR><BR>The next Commission, which will take office on 1 November 2004, will be appointed under this procedure.<BR><BR>See:<BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Composition of the European Commission ">Composition of the European Commission </A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://European Commission">European Commission</A> <BR>•<A HREF="bword://President of the European Commission">President of the European Commission</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Treaty of Nice">Treaty of Nice</A><BR><BR>
Consolidation of legislation - formal/official	Formal or official consolidation of legislation involves adopting a new legal instrument, published in the Official Journal (L series), which incorporates and repeals the instruments being consolidated (basic instrument + amending instrument(s)) without altering their substance. It can be:<BR><BR>•<I>vertical</I>: the new instrument incorporates the basic instrument and instruments amending it into a single instrument;<BR>•<I>horizontal</I>: the new instrument incorporates several parallel basic instruments - and amendments thereto - relating to the same matter into a single instrument.<BR><BR>See:<BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Simplification of legislation">Simplification of legislation</A> <BR><BR>
Consolidation of legislation - informal/declaratory	There is a special procedure for unofficial, purely declaratory consolidation of legislation and simplification of legal instruments. The incorporation of subsequent amendments into the body of a basic act does not entail the adoption of a new instrument. It is simply a clarification exercise conducted by the Commission. The resulting text, which has no formal legal effect, can, where appropriate, be published in the Official Journal (C Series) without citations or recitals.<BR><BR>See:<BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Simplification of legislation">Simplification of legislation</A> <BR><BR>
Consultation procedure	The consultation procedure enables the European Parliament to give its opinion on a proposal from the Commission. In the cases laid down by the Treaty, the Council must consult the European Parliament before voting on the Commission proposal and take its views into account. However, it is not bound by the Parliament's position but only by the obligation to consult it. The Parliament should be consulted again if the Council deviates too far from the initial proposal. The powers of the Parliament are fairly limited under this procedure, in so far as it can only hope that the Commission takes its amendments into account in an amended proposal.<BR><BR>Apart from the cases laid down by the Treaties, the Council has also undertaken to consult the Parliament on most important questions. This consultation is optional. In addition, this consultation procedure is used for the adoption of non-mandatory instruments, especially recommendations and opinions issued by the Council and the Commission.<BR><BR>The European Convention established by the Laeken declaration of December 2001 has the task of drawing up proposals aimed at simplifying the procedures for adopting various Community acts and is therefore examining the future of consultation.<BR><BR>See:<BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Assent procedure">Assent procedure</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Codecision procedure">Codecision procedure</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Council of the European Union">Council of the European Union</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://European Commission">European Commission</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://European Parliament">European Parliament</A> <BR><BR>
Consumer protection	Consumer protection is dealt with in Article 153 of the EC Treaty (former Article 129a), which was inserted by the Treaty of Maastricht. It is intended to promote consumers' health, safety, economic and legal interests, and their right to information.<BR><BR>Article 153 explicitly refers to another legal basis for the attainment of its objectives, namely to Article 95 (former Article 100a), which requires the codecision procedure for all measures involving closer alignment of Member States' legislation on completion of the single market where consumer protection is concerned. At the same time, it stipulates that specific action supporting and supplementing the policy pursued by the Member States is to be adopted under the codecision procedure, after consultation of the Economic and Social Committee.<BR><BR>A Member State may keep or introduce stricter consumer protection measures than those laid down by the Community, as long as they are compatible with the Treaty and the Commission is notified of them.<BR><BR>See:<BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Codecision procedure">Codecision procedure</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Food safety">Food safety</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Genetically modified organisms (GMO)">Genetically modified organisms (GMO)</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Precautionary Principle">Precautionary Principle</A><BR><BR>
Convention (Title VI of the EU Treaty)|Convention|Title VI of the EU Treaty	Cooperation on justice and home affairs (Title VI of the EU Treaty) was introduced by the Treaty of Maastricht in 1993. This made provision for various specific instruments, including conventions. Since the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam, conventions may only be used for police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters and they are now governed by new rules.<BR><BR>Based on the new Article 34 of the EU Treaty, a convention is adopted by unanimous decision of the Council after consulting the European Parliament and then ratified by the Member States in accordance with their respective constitutional procedures. After being ratified by at least half the Member States, a convention enters into force in those States.<BR><BR>The Court of Justice now has jurisdiction to give preliminary rulings on their interpretation and to rule on any disputes regarding their application. However, its role is subject to approval by the Member States. Each of them must make a declaration stating that they accept the Court's jurisdiction and designating the national courts that may refer questions to it.<BR><BR>See:<BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Court of Justice of the European Union">Court of Justice of the European Union</A> <BR>•<A HREF="bword://Justice and home affairs (JHA)">Justice and home affairs (JHA)</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters">Police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters</A><BR><BR>
Convergence criteria	To ensure that the sustainable convergence required for the achievement of economic and monetary union (EMU) comes about, the Treaty sets five convergence criteria which must be met by each Member State before it can take part in the third stage of EMU. The Commission and the European Central Bank (ECB) draw up reports to check whether the criteria are being met. The criteria are:<BR><BR>•the ratio of government deficit to gross domestic product must not exceed 3%;<BR>•the ratio of government debt to gross domestic product must not exceed 60%;<BR>•there must be a sustainable degree of price stability and an average inflation rate, observed over a period of one year before the examination, which does not exceed by more than one and a half percentage points that of the three best performing Member States in terms of price stability;<BR>•there must be a long-term nominal interest rate which does not exceed by more than two percentage points that of the three best performing Member States in terms of price stability;<BR>•the normal fluctuation margins provided for by the exchange-rate mechanism on the European Monetary system must have been respected without severe tensions for at least the last two years before the examination.<BR><BR>The convergence criteria, then, are meant to ensure that economic development within EMU is balanced and does not give rise to any tensions between the Member States. It must also be remembered that the criteria relating to government deficit and government debt must continue to be met after the start of the third stage of EMU (1 January 1999). A stability pact with this end in view was adopted at the Amsterdam European Council in June 1997.<BR><BR>See:<BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Economic and monetary union">Economic and monetary union</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Stability and Growth Pact">Stability and Growth Pact</A><BR><BR>
Cooperation procedure	The cooperation procedure (Article 252 of the EC Treaty, formerly Article 189c) was introduced by the Single European Act. It gave the European Parliament greater influence in the legislative process by allowing it two "readings". Initially, the scope of this procedure was considerably extended by the Treaty of Maastricht; the Treaty of Amsterdam then reversed the trend by encouraging the codecision procedure (Article 251 of the EC Treaty). The cooperation procedure will therefore now apply exclusively to the field of economic and monetary union (Articles 99(5) and 106(2) of the EC Treaty).<BR><BR>The cooperation procedure is always initiated by a proposal from the Commission forwarded to the Council and the European Parliament. In the context of a first reading, Parliament issues an opinion on the Commission proposal. The Council, acting by a qualified majority, then draws up a common position, which is forwarded to Parliament together with all the necessary information and the reasons which led the Council to adopt this common position.<BR>Parliament examines this common position at second reading, and within three months may adopt, amend or reject the common position. In the latter two cases, it must do so by an absolute majority of its members. If it rejects the proposal, unanimity is required for the Council to act on a second reading.<BR><BR>The Commission then re-examines, within one month, the proposal upon which the Council based its common position and forwards its proposal to the Council; at its discretion it can include or exclude the amendments proposed by Parliament.<BR><BR>Within three months, the Council may adopt the re-examined proposal by qualified majority, amend it unanimously or adopt the amendments not taken into consideration by the Commission, also unanimously.<BR><BR>In the cooperation procedure, the Council may still exercise a veto by refusing to express its opinion on the amendments proposed by the European Parliament or on the amended proposal from the Commission, thereby blocking the legislative procedure.<BR><BR>The European Convention established by the Laeken declaration of December 2001 has the task of drawing up proposals aimed at simplifying the procedures for adopting various Community acts and is therefore examining the future of cooperation.<BR><BR>See:<BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Assent procedure">Assent procedure</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Codecision procedure">Codecision procedure</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Consultation procedure">Consultation procedure</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Council of the European Union">Council of the European Union</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Economic and monetary union (EMU)">Economic and monetary union (EMU)</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://European Commission">European Commission</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://European Parliament">European Parliament</A><BR><BR>
Coreper	Coreper, the French acronym by which the Permanent Representatives Committee is known, consists of the Member States' Permanent Representatives (Ambassadors) and is responsible, at a stage involving preliminary negotiations, for assisting the Council of the European Union in dealing with the items on its agenda (proposals and drafts of instruments put forward by the Commission). It occupies a pivotal position in the Community decision-making system, in which it is at one and the same time a forum for dialogue (among the Permanent Representatives and between them and their respective national capitals) and a body which exercises political control (by laying down guidelines for, and supervising, the work of the expert groups). It is in fact divided in two to enable it to deal with all the tasks it has to carry out:<BR><BR>•Coreper I, consisting of the Deputy Permanent Representatives, and<BR>•Coreper II, consisting of the Permanent Representatives themselves.<BR><BR>The smooth running of the Council is dependent on the standard of the work done in Coreper.<BR><BR>See:<BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Council of the European Union ">Council of the European Union </A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://European Commission">European Commission</A><BR><BR>
Council of the European Union	The Council of the European Union (Council, sometimes referred to as the Council of Ministers) is the Union's main decision-making institution. It consists of the ministers of the fifteen Member States responsible for the area of activity on the agenda: foreign affairs, agriculture, industry, transport or whatever. Despite the existence of these different configurations depending on the area of activity, the Council is nonetheless a single institution.<BR><BR>Each Member State in turn holds the chair for six months. Decisions are prepared by the Committee of Permanent Representatives of the Member States (Coreper), assisted by working parties of national government officials. The Council is assisted by its General Secretariat. Council decisions under the first pillar are adopted on the basis of Commission proposals.<BR><BR>Following entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam in May 1999, the Secretary-General also acts as High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy. He is assisted by a Deputy Secretary-General, appointed by unanimous decision of the Council and responsible for running the Council's General Secretariat.<BR><BR>Given the prospect of enlargement, the Treaty of Nice extended the scope of decisions adopted by qualified majority to other areas and to certain other aspects of policies already subject in part to qualified majority voting, such as the common commercial policy.<BR><BR>See:<BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Committees and working parties">Committees and working parties</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Coreper">Coreper</A> <BR>•<A HREF="bword://High Representative for the CFSP (Mr/Ms CFSP)">High Representative for the CFSP (Mr/Ms CFSP)</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Presidency of the Union (rotation of the Presidency)">Presidency of the Union (rotation of the Presidency)</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Qualified majority">Qualified majority</A> <BR>•<A HREF="bword://Right of initiative">Right of initiative</A> <BR>•<A HREF="bword://Troika">Troika</A> <BR>•<A HREF="bword://Unanimity">Unanimity</A><BR><BR>
Court of First Instance of the European Communities (CFI)|CFI|Court of First Instance of the European Communities	The CFI was set up in 1989 to strengthen the protection of individuals' interests by introducing a second tier of judicial authority, allowing the Court of Justice of the European Union to concentrate on its basic task of ensuring the uniform interpretation and application of Community law.<BR><BR>The CFI is currently made up of fifteen judges appointed by common accord of the Governments of the Member States to hold office for a renewable term of six years. It should be noted that in response to a request submitted by the Court of Justice, outside the framework of the Intergovernmental Conference, the Permanent Representatives' Committee agreed to increase the number of judges for the CFI to twenty-one. The arrangements regarding the system of rotation for appointments has still to be decided.<BR><BR>The Treaty of Nice introduced greater flexibility for adapting the CFI's statute, which can henceforth be amended by the Council acting unanimously at the request of the Court or of the Commission. The approval of the rules of procedure of the Court of Justice and of the Court of First Instance will in future be by qualified majority.<BR><BR>To ease the workload of the Court of Justice, the Treaty of Nice also aimed to improve the distribution of responsibilities between the Court and the CFI, making the CFI the ordinary court for all direct actions (appeals against a decision, failure to act, damages, etc.), with the exception of those assigned to a judicial panel and those reserved for the Court of Justice. The new Treaty also provides for the creation, based on a right of initiative shared between the Court of Justice and the Commission, of judicial panels to examine at first instance certain types of actions in specific matters to relieve the burden on the CFI. Finally, the Nice Treaty provides for the possibility of conferring on the Court of First Instance the right to deliver preliminary rulings in certain specific areas. <BR><BR>See also:<BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Court of Justice of the European Union">Court of Justice of the European Union</A><BR><BR>
Court of Justice of the European Union	The Court of Justice of the European Union is composed of as many judges as there are Member States. At present it has fifteen judges assisted by eight advocates-general appointed for six years by agreement among the Member States. <BR><BR>It may sit in chambers, or in plenary session for cases that are particularly important or complex and at the request of a Member State. <BR><BR>It has two principal functions: <BR><BR>•to check whether instruments of the European institutions and of governments are compatible with the Treaties;<BR>•to pronounce, at the request of a national court, on the interpretation or the validity of provisions contained in Community law.<BR><BR>The Court is assisted by the Court of First Instance of the European Communities (CFI), which was set up in 1989.<BR><BR>The Treaty of Nice put in place a major reform of the Union's court system. As far as the Court of Justice is concerned, the most important points are the following: <BR><BR>•greater flexibility to adapt the statute of the Court of Justice, which can now be amended by the Council, acting unanimously at the request of the Court or the Commission;<BR>•approval of the Court's Rules of Procedure by the Council is now done by qualified majority;<BR>•a new Article 229a of the EC Treaty enables the Court to be awarded jurisdiction in disputes relating to Community industrial property rights, by unanimous decision by the Council and after ratification by the national parliaments;<BR>•a better division of powers between the CFI and the Court, relieving the latter of some of its workload.<BR><BR>See:<BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://The Court of First Instance of the European Communities (CFI)">The Court of First Instance of the European Communities (CFI)</A><BR><BR>
Culture	Whilst the will to conduct cultural activities at European level was apparent as early as the 1970s, it was not until 1991 that culture was officially given a place in European integration, through Article 151 of the Maastricht Treaty, which states that "The Community shall contribute to the flowering of the cultures of the Member States, while respecting their national and regional diversity and at the same time bringing the common cultural heritage to the fore". <BR><BR>To create a real European cultural area, the Union is called upon to promote cooperation between the Member States and, if necessary, to support and complement their activities in the following areas:<BR><BR>•the dissemination of the culture and history of the European peoples; <BR>•the conservation of cultural heritage of European significance; <BR>•non-commercial cultural exchanges; <BR>•artistic, literary and audiovisual creation; <BR>•cooperation with third countries and the competent international organisations. <BR><BR>For ten years, the Commission supported cultural cooperation via three experimental programmes in this sector covering the performing, plastic and visual arts, heritage and books (Kaléïdoscope, Ariane and Raphaël). The European Community has also supported the Member States' initiative to designate a 'European City of Culture' each year since 1985. <BR><BR>In 2000, the Commission adopted the Culture 2000 framework programme, a new approach to cultural action. The aim of this programme is to create a common cultural area by promoting cultural dialogue, the creation and dissemination of culture and the mobility of artists and their works, European cultural heritage, new forms of cultural expression and the socio-economic role of culture.<BR><BR>Cultural cooperation in Europe is also promoted by specific activities funded by other European programmes than Culture 2000, in particular activities performed in the context of economic, research, education, training and regional development aid policies that also promote cultural cooperation. This cooperation in interpreted broadly, as most of the programmes are open to the member countries of the European Economic Area and the candidate countries, and third countries and international organisations are also involved. <BR><BR>See:<BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Audiovisual">Audiovisual</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Education, vocational training and youth">Education, vocational training and youth</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Subsidiarity">Subsidiarity</A><BR><BR>
Customs union	The customs union is the essential element of the common market. Its introduction was the primary objective following the signature of the Treaty of Rome and continued until 1968. The most important measures included:<BR><BR>•the elimination of all customs duties and restrictions among the Member States;<BR>•the introduction of a common customs tariff (CCT), applicable throughout the European Community to third country goods (the income obtained as a result forming part of the Community's own resources);<BR>•the common commercial policy as an external dimension of the customs union (the Community speaks with one voice at international level). <BR><BR>Common procedures and rules were drawn up together with a Single Administrative Document (SAD) aimed at replacing the different documents previously used. With the entry into force of the single market in 1993, all routine checks at internal borders were abolished, as were customs formalities. Thus, the customs services of the Member States lost their responsibility for collecting excise duties, VAT and statistical data.<BR><BR>The Community has concluded special agreements to facilitate trade, for example the agreement with the European Economic Area (EEA), and to encourage development by providing preferential access to European markets, for example the Lomé Convention, signed with the African, Caribbean and Pacific countries (ACP).<BR><BR>Future challenges include promoting closer cooperation between the national administrations and combating fraud through the successive Customs 2002 and Customs 2007 programmes. The enlargement of the Union due to take place in 2004 also raises the question of integrating the administrations of the new Member States.<BR><BR>See:<BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Common commercial policy ">Common commercial policy </A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Own resources ">Own resources </A>
Debate on the future of the European Union	Having given the green light to enlargement, the 2000 Intergovernmental Conference (IGC 2000) called for a broader and deeper debate on the future of the European Union. To this end, the Nice Declaration, annexed to the Treaty of Nice, called for the initiation of a broad debate associating all the interested parties: the representatives of the national parliaments, as well as a wide range of public opinion, i.e. political and commercial organisations, universities and representatives of civil society, in both the Member States and the candidate countries.<BR><BR>This debate on the future of the Union will continue until 2004, via discussions and the use of the Internet, so as to gather together as many opinions as possible on the key issues relating to the future of Europe. It is encouraged by the Commission, which hopes that it will be promoted both at European level, with contributions and discussion forums involving personalities from the Community, and at national level, with national debates on the future of the Union that involve a wide range of citizens.<BR>The exchanges taking place in the context of this debate are being conducted in parallel with the work of the preparatory Convention for the IGC 2004.<BR><BR>See: <BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Intergovernmental Conference (IGC)">Intergovernmental Conference (IGC)</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://European Convention">European Convention</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Laeken Declaration">Laeken Declaration</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Treaty of Nice">Treaty of Nice</A><BR><BR>
Decision and framework decision (Title VI of the EU Treaty)|Decision and framework decision|Title VI of the EU Treaty	With the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam, these new instruments under Title VI of the EU Treaty (Police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters) have replaced joint action. More binding and more authoritative, they should serve to make action under the reorganised third pillar more effective.<BR><BR>Framework decisions are used to approximate (align) the laws and regulations of the Member States.

Deepening	Deepening refers to the integration dynamic present from the outset of the European venture. Through the customs union, the common market, and then the Euro zone, the European Communities have grown into what aspires to be an "ever closer union" among the peoples of Europe (Article 1 of the EU Treaty). Deepening is a process parallel to, and often viewed as a necessary step prior to, enlargement.<BR><BR>In this spirit it has been decided to reform the main Community policies (common agricultural policy and structural policy) and the workings of the institutions to create a favourable context for new Member States to join the European Union.<BR><BR>See:<BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Enlargement">Enlargement</A><BR><BR>
Delimitation of competences	The delimitation of competences between the European Union and its Member States is one of the main points for consideration identified by the Declaration on the Future of the Union annexed to the Treaty of Nice and by the Laeken Declaration. The aim is to establish a clear and precise distribution of the Union's competences, respecting the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality whilst meeting, as far as possible, the expectations of European citizens. The system for monitoring compliance with this delimitation must also be stepped up. The aim is to better identify what comes under Community, regional or even local competence.<BR><BR>The idea of a separate title on competences in a future constitutional treaty is being studied. The issue is whether it is necessary to draw up an exhaustive list of the Union's competences, making a precise distinction between exclusive, shared and complementary competences. In any event, this delimitation must not be allowed to hinder the flexibility provided under Article 308 of the EC Treaty, which grants the Community subsidiary powers.<BR><BR>See: <BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Community competences">Community competences</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Debate on the future of the European Union">Debate on the future of the European Union</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://European Convention">European Convention</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://External competences of the European Community ">External competences of the European Community </A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Laeken Declaration">Laeken Declaration</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Subsidiarity">Subsidiarity</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Subsidiary competences ">Subsidiary competences </A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Treaty of Nice">Treaty of Nice</A><BR><BR>
Democratic deficit	The democratic deficit is a concept invoked principally in the argument that the European Union suffers from a lack of democracy and seems inaccessible to the ordinary citizen because its method of operating is so complex. The view is that the Community institutional set-up is dominated by an institution combining legislative and government powers (the Council) and an institution that lacks democratic legitimacy (the Commission - even though its Members are appointed by the Member States and are collectively accountable to Parliament).<BR><BR>As European integration has progressed, the question of democratic legitimacy has become increasingly sensitive. The Maastricht, Amsterdam and Nice Treaties have triggered the inclusion of the principle of democratic legitimacy within the institutional system by reinforcing the powers of Parliament with regard to the appointment and control of the Commission and successively extending the scope of the codecision procedure. <BR><BR>In the meantime, two wider initiatives designed to bring Europe closer to its citizens have been launched.<BR>Following the Nice European Council (7-10 December 2000), a broad public debate on the future of the Union has been started, in which citizens can take part, and a European Convention, convened by the Laeken European Council, has been asked to examine, among other things, the various aspects of democratic legitimacy. <BR><BR>See:<BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Debate on the future of the European Union ">Debate on the future of the European Union </A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://European Convention ">European Convention </A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://European Parliament">European Parliament</A> <BR>•<A HREF="bword://Governance">Governance</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Institutional balance">Institutional balance</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Confirmation of the European Commission">Confirmation of the European Commission</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://National parliaments">National parliaments</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Clarity of the Treaties (simplification of the Treaties)">Clarity of the Treaties (simplification of the Treaties)</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Subsidiarity">Subsidiarity</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Transparency (access to documents)">Transparency (access to documents)</A> <BR><BR>
Development aid	The beginnings of the European Community's development policy coincided with the signature of the Treaty of Rome in 1957, and the Member States' overseas countries and territories were its first beneficiaries. However, it is only since the entry into force of the Treaty on European Union that this policy has enjoyed a specific legal basis (Articles 177 to 181 of the EC Treaty). With the successive enlargements of the Union, cooperation has gradually extended to other countries, such as the African, Caribbean and Pacific countries (ACP) which have a particularly close and long-standing relationship with certain Member States. The Cotonou Agreement, signed in June 2000, has strengthened this partnership, which is to a large extent based on the various Lomé Conventions, the first of which was signed in 1975.<BR><BR>In addition to these initial agreements, other countries also benefit from the Community's development policy, such as the countries of Latin America and Asia.<BR><BR>The main objective of the European Community's development policy is to eradicate poverty. This policy is implemented not only through bilateral and regional agreements but also through specific programmes in certain sectors such as health, particularly with a view to combating communicable diseases, and education. The development policy also entails cooperation with international institutions and the participation of the Community and Member States in initiatives implemented at global level such as the Initiative for Highly Indebted Poor Countries.<BR><BR>Today, the Union is the main partner of developing countries. The European Community and its Member States together provide 55% of international development assistance.<BR><BR>See:<BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Humanitarian aid">Humanitarian aid</A><BR><BR>
Double majority	In the light of enlargement, solutions have been put forward for maintaining the current balance between "large" and "small" countries in decision-making in the Council of Ministers. Maintaining the present system of weighting of votes in the Council after enlargement could produce a qualified majority representing only a minority of the population of the European Union. For this reason, the Member States with the highest populations wanted to see a reweighting or double majority system which would ensure that a majority in the Council represented a majority not only of Member States but also of the population of the Union.<BR><BR>Both solutions were discussed in detail at the Intergovernmental Conference of 1996-1997, which led to the Treaty of Amsterdam.<BR><BR>The proposed double majority system gave one vote to each Member State but required the presence of a majority of Member States, representing a majority of the population, for a decision to be taken. As no agreement was reached on the proposal at the Intergovernmental Conference, a Protocol on the institutions, with a view to enlargement, was annexed to the Treaty.<BR><BR>In this Protocol, the large Member States (Germany, Spain, France, Italy, United Kingdom) agree to lose their second Commissioner after enlargement, provided that the reweighting of votes in the Council works in their favour. They see a close link between the question of a reduction in the number of Commissioners and the question of decision-making in the Council.<BR><BR>The Protocol also provides for a new Intergovernmental Conference to be convened before the Union's membership exceeds 20, in order to review the rules on the functioning of the Union institutions and, above all, to make a final decision on decision-making in the Council.<BR><BR>The new Intergovernmental Conference of February 2000 decided to adopt a system of reweighting of votes within the Council, combined with a double or even triple majority, as a requirement for adoption of an instrument within the Council. While the reweighting of votes works in favour of the large Member States, the qualified majority must also be a majority of the Member States. This is combined with a system known as the "demographic safety net" which means that each Member State can request verification of whether the qualified majority represents at least 62% of the population of the Union. If this condition is not fulfilled, the decision cannot be adopted. These new rules will enter into force on 1 November 2004.<BR><BR>See:<BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Composition of the Commission">Composition of the Commission</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Enlargement">Enlargement</A> <BR>•<A HREF="bword://Intergovernmental Conference (IGC)">Intergovernmental Conference (IGC)</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Qualified majority">Qualified majority</A> <BR>•<A HREF="bword://Reinforced qualified majority">Reinforced qualified majority</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Weighting of votes in the Council">Weighting of votes in the Council</A> <BR><BR>
EUROFOR/EUROMARFOR|EUROFOR|EUROMARFOR	The Lisbon Declaration of the Western European Union on 15 May 1995 ratified the decision by Spain, France and Italy to set up land and sea forces (EUROFOR and EUROMARFOR). These will form part of the Forces answerable to WEU (FAWEU) and should strengthen Europe's own capacity for operations under the Petersberg Declaration. Portugal has agreed to participate in the two forces when they are being used within the WEU context, without prejudice to the Member States' collective defence position (Article V, WEU, and Article 5, NATO).<BR><BR>See:<BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Collective defence">Collective defence</A> <BR>•<A HREF="bword://Common foreign and security policy (CFSP)">Common foreign and security policy (CFSP)</A> <BR>•<A HREF="bword://European Security and Defence Policy (ESDP)">European Security and Defence Policy (ESDP)</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://NATO">NATO</A> <BR>•<A HREF="bword://'New look' NATO">'New look' NATO</A> <BR>•<A HREF="bword://Petersberg tasks">Petersberg tasks</A> <BR>•<A HREF="bword://Western European Union (WEU)">Western European Union (WEU)</A><BR><BR>
Economic and Monetary Union	Economic and monetary union (EMU) is the name given to the process of harmonising the economic and monetary policies of the Member States of the Union with a view to the introduction of a single currency, the euro. It was the subject of one of the two Intergovernmental Conferences (IGCs) which concluded their deliberations in Maastricht in December 1991.<BR><BR>The Treaty provides that EMU is to be achieved in three stages:<BR><BR>•First stage (1 July 1990 to 31 December 1993): free movement of capital between Member States, closer coordination of economic policies and closer cooperation between central banks;<BR>•Second stage (1 January 1994 to 31 December 1998): convergence of the economic and monetary policies of the Member States (to ensure stability of prices and sound public finances) and the creation of the European Monetary Institute (EMI) and, in 1998, of the European Central Bank (ECB);<BR>•Third stage (from 1 January 1999): irrevocable fixing of exchange rates and introduction of the single currency on the foreign-exchange markets and for electronic payments, followed by the introduction of euro notes and coins from 1 January 2002. <BR><BR>The third stage of EMU was launched in eleven Member States, which were joined two years later by Greece. Three Member States have not adopted the single currency: the United Kingdom and Denmark, both of which benefit from an opt-out clause, and Sweden, which does not at present meet all of the criteria regarding the independence of its central bank.<BR><BR>On 1 January 2002 euro notes and coins were introduced in the Member States, gradually replacing the national currencies ("legacy" currencies). On 28 February 2002 the transitional stage of dual circulation of the legacy currencies and the euro came to an end. The euro is now the sole currency for more than 300 million Europeans. The challenges facing the long-term success of EMU are continued budgetary consolidation and closer coordination of Member States' economic policies.<BR><BR>See:<BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Convergence criteria">Convergence criteria</A> <BR>•<A HREF="bword://European Central Bank (ECB)">European Central Bank (ECB)</A> <BR>•<A HREF="bword://Intergovernmental Conference (IGC)">Intergovernmental Conference (IGC)</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Stability and Growth Pact">Stability and Growth Pact</A><BR><BR>
Economic and social cohesion	At European level, the origins of economic and social cohesion policy go back to the Treaty of Rome (1957) where a reference is made in the preamble to reducing regional disparities. In the 1970s, Community action was taken to coordinate the national instruments and provide additional financial resources. Subsequently these measures proved inadequate given the situation in the Community where the establishment of the internal market, contrary to forecasts, had failed to even out the differences between regions.<BR><BR>With the adoption of the Single European Act in 1986, economic and social cohesion proper was made an objective alongside completing the single market.<BR><BR>The Maastricht Treaty (1992), finally, incorporated the policy into the EC Treaty itself (Articles 158 to 162). Economic and social cohesion is an expression of solidarity between the Member States and regions of the European Union. The aim is balanced development throughout the EU, reducing structural disparities between regions and promoting equal opportunities for all individuals. In practical terms this is achieved by means of a variety of financing operations, principally through the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund.<BR><BR>Besides the reform of the common agricultural policy and enlargement to the Central and Eastern European countries, regional policy was one of the major issues discussed in Agenda 2000, largely because of the financial implications. It is the Community's second largest budget item, with an allocation of EUR 213 billion for the period 2000-06. Every three years the European Commission presents a report on progress made in achieving economic and social cohesion and on how Community policies have contributed to it. The main criteria used for analysis are gross domestic product (GDP), employment and factors promoting sustainable development.<BR><BR>The EU's planned enlargement in May 2004 will involve a 13% fall in average per capital GDP and a widening of regional disparities on a scale without precedent in any previous enlargement. Since 60% of the regions whose development is lagging behind are in the future Member States, economic and social cohesion policy will inevitably shift eastwards. After 2006 it will have to concentrate on crucial development concerns while continuing to support regions which have not completed the process of convergence in real terms (particularly in Spain, Greece and Portugal) and on geographical areas facing specific structural problems (areas undergoing industrial restructuring, urban areas, rural areas, areas dependent on fishing, and areas suffering from natural or demographic handicaps). Simplification of the transfer and management mechanisms for the Structural Funds will moreover be the watchword of the next reform.<BR><BR>See:<BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Agenda 2000">Agenda 2000</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Enlargement">Enlargement</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://European Investment Bank (EIB)">European Investment Bank (EIB)</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Objectives 1,2 and 3">Objectives 1,2 and 3</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Structural Funds and Cohesion Fund">Structural Funds and Cohesion Fund</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Sustainable development">Sustainable development</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Trans-European Networks (TENs)">Trans-European Networks (TENs)</A><BR><BR>
Economic policy	Economic and monetary union (EMU) implies close coordination of national economic policies, which have thus become a matter of common concern. In practical terms, the Council, acting by a qualified majority on a recommendation from the Commission, formulates draft guidelines which are sent to the European Council. In the light of the latter's conclusions, the Council, again acting by qualified majority, adopts a recommendation setting out the Broad Economic Policy Guidelines (BEPG) of the of the Member States and the Community and informs the European Parliament (Article 99 of the EC Treaty). These annual broad guidelines are the central element of coordination for the Union's economic policies.<BR><BR>In addition to these broad guidelines, the EC Treaty lays down other economic policy provisions in Title VII, Articles 98 to 104, including:<BR><BR>•multilateral surveillance: the Member States, meeting within the Council, monitor economic developments and the application of the broad economic policy guidelines; they may issue recommendations to the government of a Member State which is failing to comply with the guidelines;<BR>•the excessive-deficit procedure: the Member States must avoid excessive government deficits, and it is up to the Commission to ensure that this principle is complied with; Article 104 lays down the relevant procedure, conditions, exceptions and consequences, which may include fines; <BR>•financial assistance: when a Member State is experiencing severe difficulties , the Council is able, under certain conditions, to grant it financial assistance;<BR>•prohibition against assuming the commitments of other Member States: the Community or the Member States may not assume the commitments of other Member States;<BR>•prohibition of privileged access: it is prohibited to grant public bodies, authorities or undertakings privileged access to finance.<BR><BR>Title VII of the EC Treaty also lays down the institutional provisions applicable to the European Central Bank (Articles 112 to 115) and the transitional provisions necessary for the implementation of the various stages of EMU (Articles 116 to 124).<BR><BR>See:<BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Cooperation procedure">Cooperation procedure</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Consultation procedure">Consultation procedure</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Convergence criteria">Convergence criteria</A> <BR>•<A HREF="bword://Council of the European Union">Council of the European Union</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Economic and monetary Union (EMU)">Economic and monetary Union (EMU)</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Employment">Employment</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://European Central Bank (ECB)">European Central Bank (ECB)</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://European Commission">European Commission</A> <BR>•<A HREF="bword://European Council">European Council</A> <BR>•<A HREF="bword://European Parliament">European Parliament</A> <BR>•<A HREF="bword://Monetary policy">Monetary policy</A> <BR>•<A HREF="bword://Qualified majority">Qualified majority</A> <BR>•<A HREF="bword://Stability and Growth Pact">Stability and Growth Pact</A><BR><BR>
Education, vocational training and youth|Education vocational training and youth	The principle of subsidiarity means that each Member State assumes full responsibility for the organisation of its education and vocational training systems and the content of teaching. In accordance with Articles 149 and 150 of the EC Treaty, the Community's role is to contribute to the development of quality education by encouraging cooperation between Member States and, if necessary, by supporting and supplementing their action, especially with a view to developing the European dimension in education, encouraging mobility and promoting cooperation among European schools and universities.<BR><BR>In line with these articles, the Union therefore does not intend to develop a common education policy. However, it does have at its disposal a number of specific tools to encourage cooperation in this field: <BR><BR>•Community action programmes adopted under the European codecision procedure (Council and Parliament), namely: <BR>- SOCRATES, which encourages student mobility and, to that end, cooperation between universities (Erasmus programme), schools (Comenius programme), and language learning (Lingua programme) and promotes the development of networks with a view to the recognition of qualifications (Naric network), the provision of information in the field of education (Eurydice) and the exchange of experience between decision-makers in the field of education (Arion);<BR>- LEONARDO DA VINCI, which promotes access to vocational training by improving national vocational training systems and encouraging innovation and lifelong learning;<BR>- YOUTH, which facilitates the mobility of less-privileged young people outside education structures and enables them, through the European Voluntary Service (EVS), to participate in projects run by associations or local authorities in Europe or developing countries;<BR><BR>•Community legal acts encouraging policy cooperation between Member States, such as recommendations, communications (e.g. on lifelong learning or quality assessment of school and university education), working documents, pilot projects, etc.; <BR><BR>•two bodies supporting Union activities in the field of vocational training: the European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training (CEDEFOP), which develops academic and technical activities in support of the development of vocational training in Europe, and the European Training Foundation (ETF), which supports and coordinates the reform of vocational training systems as part of PHARE, TACIS and MEDA. <BR><BR>To achieve the goal set by the Lisbon European Council in March 2000 (to become the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world), the Commission has stepped up policy cooperation in the field of lifelong learning in order to improve the quality of education and vocational training systems, facilitate universal access to education and vocational training, and open up education and vocational training systems to the world. Helping the active population to adapt continuously to technological change is one of the main tools in the fight against unemployment and in building a genuine Europe of knowledge.<BR><BR>See:<BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://European Union Agencies">European Union Agencies</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://eEurope">eEurope</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Equal treatment for men and women">Equal treatment for men and women</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Employment">Employment</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Subsidiarity">Subsidiarity</A> <BR><BR>
Employment	Employment is one of the key concerns of the Member States, given its high average level in the Union (currently around 7.7%). Following on from the 1993 White Paper on Growth, Competitiveness and Employment, the Essen European Council (9 and 10 December 1994) identified five priority areas for action to promote employment:<BR><BR>•improving employment opportunities by promoting investment in vocational training; <BR>•increasing the employment-intensiveness of growth; <BR>•reducing non-wage labour costs; <BR>•increasing the effectiveness of labour-market policies; <BR>•improving help for groups which are particularly hard hit by unemployment. <BR><BR>The Council and the Commission presented a joint report on the action taken on these five priorities at the Dublin European Council (13 and 14 December 1996).<BR><BR>Similarly, the Confidence Pact for Employment presented in June 1996 seeks to mobilise all the actors concerned in a genuine employment strategy, to make employment a matter of common interest at European level and incorporate the fight against unemployment into a medium and long-term vision of society.<BR><BR>With the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam, employment is now enshrined as one of the European Community's objectives. The Community has been assigned the new responsibility of working towards a European strategy for employment together with the Member States. To this end, a new title on employment (Title VIII) has been written into the EC Treaty, under which:<BR><BR>•employment is to be taken into consideration in other Community policies; <BR>•coordination mechanisms are to be established at Community level (adoption each year by the Council of guidelines on employment compatible with the broad economic policy guidelines, surveillance of their implementation in the Member States, creation of an employment committee); <BR>•the possibility for the Council, acting by a qualified majority, to adopt incentive measures, including pilot projects and recommendations to Member States, in the light of its annual review of their employment policies. <BR><BR>An extraordinary summit on employment held in Luxembourg on 21 November 1997 agreed that the European Employment Strategy should focus on four themes: employability, entrepreneurship, adaptability and equal opportunities. The Member States then decided to bring forward to 1998 the application of the provisions on coordinating their employment policies.<BR><BR>At the Lisbon European summit in March 2000, the heads of state and government reached agreement on a new strategic goal for the Union for the next decade: to become the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world, capable of sustainable economic growth with more and better jobs and greater social cohesion.<BR><BR>To reach the target of full employment in the Union by 2010 set by the Lisbon European Council, the new communication on the future of the European Employment Strategy, published in January 2003, established several priorities: to reduce the unemployment rate, to encourage women to enter the labour market, to encourage people who have reached retirement age to stay in employment, to promote lifelong learning, to promote entrepreneurship, and to combat undeclared work.<BR><BR>See:<BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Competitiveness">Competitiveness</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Education, vocational training and youth">Education, vocational training and youth</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Employment Committee ">Employment Committee </A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://European Employment Strategy (EES)">European Employment Strategy (EES)</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Intergovernmental Conference (IGC)">Intergovernmental Conference (IGC)</A> <BR><BR>

Energy	The aim of European Union energy policy is to guarantee secure, low-cost energy supplies which pose no risk to the health of citizens and the environment.<BR><BR>At the outset, the Treaties establishing the European Communities made no provision for a Community energy policy.<BR><BR>The beginning of the process of constructing Europe saw the establishment of institutional frameworks for coal and atomic energy:<BR><BR>•in 1951, the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC), the Treaty for which expired on 31 December 2002;<BR>•in 1957, the European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom).<BR><BR>Subsequent treaties did not create a specific legal basis for Community energy policy, the underlying principles of which are still based on the Euratom Treaty and on a number of provisions contained in the "internal market" and "environment" chapters.<BR><BR>In the present energy situation, the European Union has to face up to many challenges: development of renewable energy sources, opening up of the gas and electricity markets, reduction of the European Union's energy dependency and nuclear safety and security guarantees.<BR><BR>Confronted with these new energy challenges, the European Union has taken measures aimed in particular at guaranteeing security of supply in the face of its dependency on imports of oil from politically unstable regions, redefining priorities in relation to nuclear energy taking account in particular of the risks of accidents and disposal of waste, as well as promoting sustainable development.<BR><BR>With the new intelligent energy for Europe action programme, the Commission is therefore proposing to step up European support for the promotion of renewable energies (ALTENER) and energy efficiency (SAVE), while redirecting international action towards these two priorities (COOPENER).<BR><BR>See:<BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Environment">Environment</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Sustainable development">Sustainable development</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Trans-European Networks (TEN)">Trans-European Networks (TEN)</A><BR><BR>
Enlargement	Enlargement was originally the term used to refer to the four successive waves of new members joining the European Community. Nine countries have so far joined the six founder members - Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg and the Netherlands - at the following times:<BR><BR>•1973: Denmark, Ireland and the United Kingdom; <BR>•1981: Greece; <BR>•1986: Portugal and Spain; <BR>•1995: Austria, Finland and Sweden. <BR><BR>The current wave of accessions has turned enlargement into a unique opportunity to bring peace, stability and prosperity to the entire continent of Europe. It is an unprecedented enlargement in terms of its dimension and diversity and involves 10 applicant countries from Central and Eastern Europe (Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia) as well as two Mediterranean countries (Malta and Cyprus) and Turkey.<BR><BR>At the Copenhagen European Council (12 and 13 December 2002), the Commission concluded negotiations with 10 of these countries - Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia - thus enabling them to join the Union on 1 May 2004. As far as Bulgaria and Romania are concerned, the goal is to conclude negotiations in time for them to join in 2007. The possibility of opening negotiations with Turkey will be examined in December 2004.<BR><BR>See:<BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Accession negotiations">Accession negotiations</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Accession of new Member States of the European Union">Accession of new Member States of the European Union</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Agenda 2000">Agenda 2000</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Applicant countries">Applicant countries</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Composition of the Commission">Composition of the Commission</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Deepening">Deepening</A> <BR>•<A HREF="bword://Intergovernmental Conference (IGC)">Intergovernmental Conference (IGC)</A> <BR>•<A HREF="bword://Weighting of votes in the Council">Weighting of votes in the Council</A><BR><BR>
Enterprise policy	The objective of enterprise policy is to make it easier to create and develop enterprises or industries within the European Union.<BR>The European Commission coordinates the initiatives of the Member States in this area while the Council, further to proposals from the Commission and after consultation with the European Parliament, decides unanimously on the measures designed to support the Member States' initiatives.<BR>Enterprise policy aims to allow enterprises to adapt to structural changes and expand, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises. It also aims to stimulate cooperation between enterprises and to encourage them to make full use of the benefits of research, technological developments and innovation.<BR>At the European Council in Lisbon on 23 and 24 March 2000, the Heads of State and Government declared that the European Union's objective was to become the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world by 2010. Enterprise policy is helping to achieve this objective by fostering entrepreneurial spirit and innovation through the best possible use of the benefits conveyed by the internal market, by coordinating policies in the Member States through standardisation or the exchange of best practices, and by developing electronic commerce.<BR><BR>See:<BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Competitiveness">Competitiveness</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Concentration">Concentration</A><BR><BR>
Environment	The aim of the Community's environment policy is to preserve, protect and improve the quality of the environment and to protect people's health. It also sets great store by the prudent and rational use of natural resources. Lastly, it seeks to promote measures at international level to deal with regional or worldwide environmental problems (Article 174, formerly Article 130r of the EC Treaty).<BR><BR>Policy formulation is subject to different decision-making procedures depending on the area concerned. So to attain the objectives listed, the Council:<BR><BR>•acts unanimously, after consulting the European Parliament, the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions, where fiscal provisions and provisions relating to town and country planning or land use (with the exception of waste management and general measures) are involved or where a Member State's choice in the matter of energy is significantly affected (Article 175(2)). <BR>•acts under the codecision procedure, after consulting the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions, for the adoption of general action programmes setting out the priority objectives to be attained. <BR><BR>The Treaty of Amsterdam has enshrined the concept of "sustainable development" as one of the European Union's objectives, while environmental protection requirements have been given greater weight in other Community policies, especially in the context of the internal market (Articles 2 and 6 of the EC Treaty). <BR><BR>The provisions allowing a Member State to apply stricter rules than the harmonised rules have been made easier. These stricter rules must be compatible with the Treaty and must be communicated to the Commission.<BR><BR>Environmental policy is based on the precautionary principle and on the principles that preventive action should be taken, that environmental damage should be rectified at source and that the polluter should pay. <BR><BR>See:<BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Codecision procedure ">Codecision procedure </A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Consultation procedure ">Consultation procedure </A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Food safety">Food safety</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Genetically modified organisms (GMO)">Genetically modified organisms (GMO)</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Kyoto Protocol">Kyoto Protocol</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Precautionary principle">Precautionary principle</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Qualified majority">Qualified majority</A> <BR>•<A HREF="bword://Sustainable development ">Sustainable development </A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Unanimity">Unanimity</A> <BR><BR>
Equal opportunities	Two key elements of the general principle of equal opportunities are the ban on discrimination on grounds of nationality (Article 12 of the EC Treaty, formerly Article 6) and equal pay for men and women (Article 141 of the EC Treaty, formerly Article 119). It is intended to apply to all fields, particularly economic, social, cultural and family life.<BR><BR>The Treaty of Amsterdam added a new Article 13 to the Treaty, reinforcing the principle of non-discrimination, which is closely linked to equal opportunities. Under this new Article, the Council has the power to take appropriate action to combat discrimination based on sex, racial or ethnic origin, religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation.<BR><BR>Adopted in December 2000, the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union includes a chapter entitled "Equality" which sets out the principles of non-discrimination, equality between men and women, and cultural, religious and linguistic diversity. It also covers the rights of the child, the elderly and persons with disabilities. On the subject of non-discrimination, the Charter states that: "Any discrimination based on any ground such as sex, race, colour, ethnic or social origin, genetic features, language, religion or belief, political or any other opinion, membership of a national minority, property, birth, disability, age or sexual orientation shall be prohibited." <BR><BR>See:<BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Charter of Fundamental Rights">Charter of Fundamental Rights</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Equal treatment for men and women">Equal treatment for men and women</A> <BR><BR>
Equal treatment for men and women	As early as 1957, Article 141 (former Article 119) of the EC Treaty laid down the principle that men and women should receive equal pay for equal work. Since 1975 a series of directives have broadened the principle to cover access to employment, training and career progression, the aim being to eliminate all forms of discrimination at work. Equal treatment was later extended to social security, statutory schemes and occupational schemes. In the 1980s recognition of this principle led to the promotion of equal opportunities via multiannual programmes.<BR><BR>The Treaty of Amsterdam seeks to supplement Article 141 (which is rather limited in scope, covering only equal pay) by including the promotion of equality between men and women as one of the tasks of the Community set out in Article 2 of the EC Treaty.<BR><BR>The Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, adopted in December 2000, includes a chapter entitled "Equality" which sets out the principles of equality between men and women. It states that "Equality between men and women must be ensured in all areas, including employment, work and pay."<BR><BR>In June 2000, the Commission also adopted a Communication entitled <I>Towards a Community Framework Strategy on Gender Equality</I> (2001-2005). Its purpose is to establish a framework for action within which all Community activities can contribute to attaining the goal of eliminating inequalities and promoting equality between women and men.<BR><BR>See:<BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Charter of Fundamental Rights">Charter of Fundamental Rights</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Education, vocational training and youth">Education, vocational training and youth</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Equal opportunities">Equal opportunities</A><BR><BR>
Eurocorps	Eurocorps was set up at the 59th Franco-German summit, which took place in La Rochelle on 21 and 22 May 1992. Three other countries have since joined it: Belgium on 25 June 1993, Spain on 10 December 1993 and Luxembourg on 7 May 1996. It comprises 50 000 men and has been operational since 30 November 1995, following the Pegasus-95 exercise.<BR><BR>Eurocorps forms part of the Forces Answerable to Western European Union (FAWEU). It can operate as such within the WEU (Article V) or NATO (Article 5) and can be mobilised for humanitarian missions, missions to evacuate Member State nationals and peace-restoring or peace-keeping operations, under the aegis of the United Nations or the OSCE. The commitment of Eurocorps under the political control of the WEU was the subject of an agreement signed on 24 September 1993 and commitment under NATO authority was codified by the agreement of 21 January 1993.<BR><BR>Since June 2001, Eurocorps has been a rapid reaction force which is at the disposal of the EU and NATO.<BR><BR>See:<BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Collective defence">Collective defence</A> <BR>•<A HREF="bword://Common foreign and security policy (CFSP)">Common foreign and security policy (CFSP)</A> <BR>•<A HREF="bword://EUROFOR/EUROMARFOR">EUROFOR/EUROMARFOR</A> <BR>•<A HREF="bword://European Security and Defence Policy (ESDP)">European Security and Defence Policy (ESDP)</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organisation)">NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organisation)</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://'New look' NATO">'New look' NATO</A> <BR>•<A HREF="bword://Petersberg tasks">Petersberg tasks</A> <BR>•<A HREF="bword://Western European Union (WEU)">Western European Union (WEU)</A><BR><BR>

Europe agreement	A Europe agreement is a specific type of association agreement concluded between the European Union and certain Central and Eastern European states. Its aim is to prepare the associated state for accession to the European Union, and is based on respect of human rights, democracy, the rule of law and the market economy. To date, Europe agreements have been concluded with ten countries: Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia (the Slovene agreement was signed on 10 June 1996 but has not yet come into force).<BR><BR>A Europe agreement is concluded for an indefinite period and is made up of a number of elements:<BR><BR>•a political aspect, providing for bilateral and multilateral consultations on any questions of common interest;<BR>•a trade aspect, in order to set up a free trade area;<BR>•economic, cultural and financial cooperation;<BR>•alignment of legislation, particularly on intellectual property and competition rules.<BR><BR>As regards the institutional arrangements, the general management of a Europe agreement is the responsibility of an Association Council, made up of representatives of the Council and the Commission on the one hand and representatives of the associated state's government on the other. An Association Committee, made up of members of the Association Council, follows up the work and prepares the discussions of the Association Council. Finally, a Parliamentary Association Committee, made up of Members of the European Parliament and of the national parliament of the Associated State, may make recommendations to the Association Council.<BR><BR>See:<BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Pre-accession strategy">Pre-accession strategy</A><BR><BR>
European Central Bank (ECB)|ECB|European Central Bank	The European Central Bank was inaugurated on 30 June 1998. On 1 January 1999 it took over responsibility for implementing European monetary policy as defined by the European System of Central Banks (ESCB). As to the practicalities, the ECB's decision-making bodies (the Governing Council and the Executive Board) run the European System of Central Banks, whose tasks are to manage the volume of money in circulation, conduct foreign-exchange operations, hold and manage the Member States' official foreign-exchange reserves, and promote the smooth operation of payment systems. The ECB took over from the European Monetary Institute (EMI).<BR><BR>The Treaty of Nice, adopted in December 2000, did not change the composition of the ECB Governing Council (comprising the members of the Executive Board and the governors of the national central banks) but allows for changes to the rules on decision-making (decisions are generally adopted by simple majority of the members, each having one vote). Any such change requires a unanimous European Council decision that must be ratified by the Member States.<BR><BR>See:<BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Convergence criteria">Convergence criteria</A> <BR>•<A HREF="bword://Economic and monetary union (EMU)">Economic and monetary union (EMU)</A><BR><BR>
European Commission	The European Commission is a body with powers of initiative, implementation, management and control. It is the guardian of the Treaties and the embodiment of the interests of the Community. It is composed of twenty independent members (two each from France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom and one each from all the other countries), including a President and two Vice-Presidents. It is appointed for a five-year term by the Council, acting by qualified majority in agreement with the Member States. It is subject to a vote of appointment by the European Parliament, to which it is answerable. The Commissioners are assisted by an administration made up of directorates-general and specialised departments whose staff are divided mainly between Brussels and Luxembourg.<BR><BR>The new Commission, which took office on 23 January 2000 for a five-year term, has launched wide-ranging reforms in the institution with a view to modernising its working methods and procedures and ensuring a truly collegiate decision-making process, while delegating more in specific areas (e.g. regional policy, common agricultural policy, internal market). The importance attached by the Commission to reform is reflected in the White Paper adopted on 1 March 2000. This reform has three main strands:<BR><BR>•setting of priorities and allocation of resources;<BR>•overhaul of human resources policy;<BR>•improvement in financial management, effectiveness and empowerment. <BR><BR>See:<BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Composition of the Commission">Composition of the Commission</A> <BR>•<A HREF="bword://Confirmation of the Commission">Confirmation of the Commission</A> <BR>•<A HREF="bword://European Council">European Council</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://European Parliament">European Parliament</A> <BR>•<A HREF="bword://Intergovernmental Conference (IGC)">Intergovernmental Conference (IGC)</A> <BR>•<A HREF="bword://Monitoring the application of Community law">Monitoring the application of Community law</A> <BR>•<A HREF="bword://President of the European Commission ">President of the European Commission </A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Right of initiative">Right of initiative</A><BR><BR>
European Conference	The European Conference was set up to provide a framework for the enlargement process over the next few years, bringing together the Member States of the European Union with the European countries that are hoping to join. It is a multilateral forum for political consultation on questions of general interest, particularly:<BR><BR>•the common foreign and security policy;<BR>•justice and home affairs;<BR>•economic affairs and regional cooperation.<BR><BR>It was launched by the Luxembourg European Council in December 1997, taking up a French initiative presented in October 1997. It meets once a year at the level of Heads of State or Government and the President of the Commission, and once a year at foreign minister level. It is chaired by the country which holds the presidency of the Council of the European Union. <BR><BR>The European Conference met for the first time in London on 12 March 1998 and decided to set up a joint group of experts charged with reporting on the growing problems that organised crime poses for European societies, particularly in eastern Europe. The first meeting at ministerial level was held on 6 October 1998 in Luxembourg.<BR><BR>See:<BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Enlargement">Enlargement</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Fight against international organised crime">Fight against international organised crime</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Presidency of the Union (rotation of the Presidency)">Presidency of the Union (rotation of the Presidency)</A><BR><BR>
European Convention	At the Nice European Council in December 2000, a declaration on the future of the Union, the Nice Declaration, was adopted. The aim of this Declaration was to pursue institutional reform beyond the results of the 2000 Intergovernmental Conference (IGC 2000). It set out three steps for this reform: the launch of a debate on the future of the European Union, a Convention on institutional reform, the implementation of which was agreed by the Laeken European Council in December 2001, and finally the convening of an IGC in 2004.<BR><BR>According to the Laeken Declaration, which created it, the aim of this Convention is to examine four key questions on the future of the Union: the division of powers, the simplification of the treaties, the role of the national parliaments and the status of the Charter of Fundamental Rights.<BR><BR>The inaugural meeting of the Convention was held on 28 February 2002, and, according to the Laeken Declaration, its work will finish in March 2003.<BR><BR>Three phases are envisaged: a listening phase, a deliberating phase and a proposing phase. At the end of the last phase, a single constitutional text will be drafted. It may include various options, stating the support which each has received, or recommendations if a consensus has been reached. This document will serve as the starting point for the IGC negotiations conducted by the Heads of State and Government, who are ultimately responsible for any decision on amendments to the treaties. The plan is for this constitutional draft to be presented at the latest in June 2003 at the Thessaloniki European Council.<BR><BR>The Convention is an innovation in as far as previous IGCs have never been preceded by a phase of debate open to all stakeholders. In addition to the members of the Convention, civil society organisations can also contribute to the debate via an interactive forum, the Forum on the Future of the Union.<BR><BR>See: <BR><BR>•<A HREF="http://europa.eu.int/scadplus/european_convention/index_en.htm">Outcome of the European Convention</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Debate on the Future of the European Union">Debate on the Future of the European Union</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Intergovernmental Conference (IGC)">Intergovernmental Conference (IGC)</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Laeken Declaration">Laeken Declaration</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Treaty of Nice">Treaty of Nice</A><BR><BR>
European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR)|ECHR|European Convention on Human Rights	A European Convention on Human Rights signed in Rome under the aegis of the Council of Europe on 4 November 1950 established an unprecedented system of international protection for human rights, offering individuals the possibility of applying to the courts for the enforcement of their rights. The Convention, which has been ratified by all the Member States of the Union, established a number of supervisory bodies based in Strasbourg. These were:<BR><BR>•a Commission responsible for advance examination of applications from states or from individuals;<BR>•a European Court of Human Rights, to which cases were referred by the Commission or by a Member State following a report by the Commission (in the case of a judicial settlement);<BR>•a Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe which acted as the guardian of the ECHR and to which reference was made, where a case was not brought before the Court, to secure political settlement of a dispute.<BR><BR>The growing number of cases made it necessary to reform the supervisory arrangements established by the Convention (addition of Protocol No 11). The supervisory bodies were thus replaced on 1 November 1998, by a single European Court of Human Rights. The simplified structure shortened the length of procedures and enhanced the judicial character of the system. <BR><BR>The idea of the European Union acceding to the ECHR has often been raised. However, in an opinion given on 28 March 1996, the Court of Justice of the European Union stated that the European Communities could not accede to the Convention because the EC Treaty does not provide any powers to lay down rules or to conclude international agreements in the matter of Human Rights. Thus, for the moment, accession depends on the Treaty being amended.<BR><BR>The Treaty of Amsterdam nevertheless calls for respect for the fundamental rights guaranteed by the Convention, while formalising the judgments of the Court of Justice on the matter. With regard to relations between the two Courts, the practice developed by the Court of Justice of incorporating the principles of the Convention into Union law has made it possible to maintain coherence in their work and their independence.<BR><BR>See:<BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Human rights">Human rights</A><BR><BR>
European Council	The European Council is the term used to describe the regular meetings of the Heads of State or Government of the European Union Member States. It was set up by the communiqué issued at the close of the December 1974 Paris Summit and first met in 1975 (in Dublin, on 10 and 11 March). Before that time, from 1961 to 1974, the practice had been to hold European summit conferences. Its existence was given legal recognition by the Single European Act, while official status was conferred on it by the Treaty on European Union. It meets at least twice a year and the President of the European Commission attends as a full member. Its objectives are to give the European Union the impetus it needs in order to develop further and to define general policy guidelines.<BR><BR>See:<BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Intergovernmental Conference (IGC)">Intergovernmental Conference (IGC)</A> <BR>•<A HREF="bword://Political agenda of the European Union">Political agenda of the European Union</A> <BR><BR>
European Court of Auditors	The European Court of Auditors, based in Luxembourg, is composed of fifteen members appointed for six years by unanimous decision of the Council of the European Union after consulting the European Parliament. It checks European Union revenue and expenditure for legality and regularity and ensures that financial management is sound. It was set up in 1977 and raised to full institution status by the 1992 Treaty on European Union.<BR><BR>Under the Treaty of Amsterdam (adopted in June 1997), the Court of Auditors also has the power to report any irregularities to the European Parliament and the Council, and its audit responsibilities have been extended to Community funds managed by outside bodies and by the European Investment Bank.<BR><BR>The Treaty of Nice (adopted in December 2000) specifies in detail the composition of the Court of Auditors, which must include a national from each Member State. Also under the Treaty of Nice, the Court of Auditors is able to establish internal chambers to adopt certain categories of report or opinion.<BR><BR>See:<BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Budget">Budget</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://European Investment Bank (EIB)">European Investment Bank (EIB)</A><BR><BR>
European Economic and Social Committee (EESC)|EESC|European Economic and Social Committee	The European Economic and Social Committee was set up by the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community in 1957 to represent the interests of the various economic and social groups. It consists of 222 members falling into three categories: employers, workers and representatives of particular types of activity (such as farmers, craftsmen, small businesses and industry, the professions, consumer representatives, scientists and teachers, cooperatives, families, environmental movements). Members are appointed by unanimous Council decision for four years and this term may be renewed.<BR><BR>The EESC is consulted before a great many instruments concerning the internal market, education, consumer protection, environment, regional development and social affairs are adopted. It may also issue opinions on its own initiative. Since the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam (May 1999), the EESC has to be consulted on an even wider range of issues (the new employment policy, the new social affairs legislation, public health and equal opportunities) and it may also be consulted by the European Parliament.<BR><BR>The Treaty of Nice, adopted in December 2000, did not change the number and distribution by Member State of seats on the Committee. However, eligibility for membership was clarified: the EESC is to consist of "representatives of the various economic and social components of organised civil society" (Article 257 of the EC Treaty).<BR><BR>See:<BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Social dialogue">Social dialogue</A> <BR>•<A HREF="bword://Social partners">Social partners</A><BR><BR>
European Employment Strategy (EES)|EES|European Employment Strategy	The Treaty of Amsterdam introduced the concept of a European strategy for employment, following on from the integrated strategy for employment launched at the Essen European Council in December 1994.<BR><BR>At Essen, the European Council had asked the Member States to draw up multiannual programmes for employment (MAPs) and to provide the Commission with reports on their implementation. These reports describe the main measures taken by the governments to apply their multiannual programmes over the previous twelve months, assess, in certain cases, the impact of those measures on employment, and announce major changes or new initiatives in this field.<BR><BR>The European Employment Strategy is built around priority themes under the four pillars of employability, entrepreneurship, adaptability and equal opportunities. Each year, the Member States draw up National Action Plans on Employment (NAPS) implementing these broad policy guidelines. The NAPS are analysed by the Commission and the Council, and the results, presented in a Joint Employment Report, serve as a basis for reprioritising and making recommendations to Member States in respect of their employment policies.<BR><BR>Five years after its launch, the European strategy is entering a phase of review.<BR><BR>In January 2003, the Commission adopted a communication presenting a new approach through the European Employment Strategy, better adapted to the needs of an ageing population, increasing women's participation in the labour market, enlargement and the increasing pace of economic change. Main priorities of the new strategy are full employment and better working conditions.<BR><BR>See:<BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Competitiveness">Competitiveness</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Employment">Employment</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Equal treatment for men and women">Equal treatment for men and women</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Objectives 1, 2 and 3">Objectives 1, 2 and 3</A><BR><BR>
European Investment Bank (EIB)|EIB|European Investment Bank	Set up by the Treaty of Rome, the European Investment Bank is the Community's financial institution. Its task is to contribute to the balanced development of the Community by way of economic integration and social cohesion.<BR><BR>The EIB's shareholders are the Member States of the European Union. The bank is administered by the Board of Governors, which comprises the fifteen finance ministers. It has legal personality and is financially independent. It provides long-term financing for practical projects the economic, technical, environmental and financial viability of which is guaranteed. It grants loans essentially from resources borrowed on capital markets, to which is added shareholders' equity. Between 1994 and 1999 the transport, telecommunications, energy, water, education and training sectors were the main beneficiaries.<BR><BR>In March 2000 the conclusions of the Lisbon European Council called for a strengthening of support for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The "EIB Group", which comprises the EIB and the European Investment Fund (EIF), was thus created with a view to boosting European competitiveness. Via the Innovation 2000 initiative, it fosters entrepreneurship, innovation and the optimal utilisation of human resources by granting medium-term loans and bank guarantees and by financing venture capital activities.<BR><BR>Outside the European Union the EIB supports the pre-accession strategies of the Central and Eastern European countries and manages the financial dimension of the agreements concluded under European development aid and cooperation policies.<BR><BR>See:<BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Economic and social cohesion">Economic and social cohesion</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Enlargement">Enlargement</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Trans-European Networks (TENs)">Trans-European Networks (TENs)</A><BR><BR>

It originates in a joint action adopted by the Council on 29 June 1998. <BR><BR>The judicial network is made up of contact points designed to enable local judicial authorities and judicial authorities in the other Member States to establish direct contacts between themselves. These contact points also provide the legal or practical information necessary to help the authorities concerned to prepare an effective request for judicial cooperation.<BR><BR>There is also a European Judicial Network in civil and commercial matters, established by Council Decision of 28 May 2001 and based on the network in criminal matters.<BR><BR>See: <BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Area of freedom, security and justice">Area of freedom, security and justice</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Joint action (Justice and home affairs)">Joint action (Justice and home affairs)</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Justice and Home Affairs (JHA)">Justice and Home Affairs (JHA)</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters">Police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters</A><BR><BR>
European Parliament	The European Parliament is the assembly of the representatives of the 370 million Union citizens. Since 1979 they have been elected by direct universal suffrage and today total 626, distributed between Member States by reference to their population. The European Parliament's main functions are as follows:<BR><BR>•it considers the Commission's proposals and is associated with the Council in the legislative process, in some cases as co-legislator, by means of various procedures (codecision procedure, cooperation procedure, assent, advisory opinion etc.); <BR>•it has the power of control over the Union's activities through its confirmation of the appointment of the Commission (and the right to censure it) and through the written and oral questions it can put to the Commission and the Council; <BR>•it shares budgetary powers with the Council in voting on the annual budget, rendering it enforceable through the President of Parliament's signature, and overseeing its implementation. <BR><BR>It also appoints an Ombudsman empowered to receive complaints from Union citizens concerning maladministration in the activities of the Community institutions or bodies. Finally, it can set up temporary committees of inquiry, whose powers are not confined to examining the actions of the Community institutions but may also relate to actions by Member States in implementing Community policies.<BR><BR>The Treaty of Amsterdam simplified the various legislative procedures by virtually doing away with the cooperation procedure (it still applies in a few cases coming under the Title on economic and monetary union) and considerably extending the codecision procedure.<BR><BR>The Treaty of Nice, which entered into force on 1 February 2003, also enhanced Parliament's role as co-legislator by extending the co-decision procedure and granted Parliament a right to bring actions before the Court of Justice of the European Union, under the same conditions as the other institutions.<BR><BR>Looking ahead to the enlargement of the Union, the Treaty of Nice has also limited the number of MEPs to a maximum of 732, with effect from the next elections in June 2004 (the current limit, set by the Amsterdam Treaty, is 700). It also reallocated seats between Member States (which lose 91 seats) and candidate countries, reaching a compromise between the actual demographic situation and equality between Member States by respecting the principle of "appropriate representation of the peoples".<BR><BR>See:<BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Assent procedure">Assent procedure</A> <BR>•<A HREF="bword://Codecision procedure ">Codecision procedure </A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Confirmation of the Commission">Confirmation of the Commission</A> <BR>•<A HREF="bword://Consultation procedure ">Consultation procedure </A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Cooperation procedure ">Cooperation procedure </A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Democratic deficit ">Democratic deficit </A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Enlargement">Enlargement</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://National parliaments">National parliaments</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Ombudsman">Ombudsman</A> <BR>•<A HREF="bword://Uniform electoral procedure, Statute for Members of the European Parliament and European political parties ">Uniform electoral procedure, Statute for Members of the European Parliament and European political parties </A><BR><BR>
European Research Area (ERA)|ERA|European Research Area	The European Research Area brings together all of the Community's resources to better coordinate research and innovation activities at the level of both the Member States and the European Union.<BR><BR>This concept was launched by the Commission in 2000 with the idea of developing truly attractive opportunities for researchers.<BR><BR>Previously research at European level had suffered from many shortcomings: fragmentation of activities, isolation of national research systems, disparity of regulatory and administrative frameworks, and low levels of investment in knowledge.<BR><BR>Through the resources made available, the ERA should make it possible to share data, compare results, carry out multi-disciplinary studies, transfer and protect new scientific knowledge and gain access to centres of excellence and state-of-the-art equipment.<BR><BR>The European research area should thus fulfil an ambition of crucial importance to the Union, namely to develop a genuine common research policy.<BR><BR>See:<BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Research and development">Research and development</A><BR><BR>
European Security and Defence Policy (ESDP)|ESDP|European Security and Defence Policy	The European Union's European Security and Defence Policy (ESDP) includes the eventual framing of a common defence policy which might in time lead to a common defence. Established in 1999 at the Cologne European Council, the ESDP aims to allow the Union to develop its civilian and military capacities for crisis management and conflict prevention at international level thus helping to maintain peace and international security, in accordance with the United Nations Charter. The ESDP, which does not involve the creation of a European army, is developing in a manner that is compatible and coordinated with NATO.<BR><BR>With the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam, new tasks have been included in the Treaty on European Union (Title V). This important innovation relates to humanitarian and rescue operations, peacekeeping operations and the use of combat forces in crisis management, including peacemaking operations (known as the "Petersberg tasks"). In addition to these civilian and military crisis management operations, the ESDP includes a conflict prevention component.<BR><BR>The Political and Security Committee (PSC), the EU Military Committee (EUMC) and EU Military Staff (EUMS) are the permanent political and military structures responsible for an autonomous, operational EU defence policy. The Helsinki European Council established the "global objective", in other words that the Union must be able to deploy, up to 60 000 persons within 60 days and for at least one year.<BR><BR>See:<BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Common foreign and security policy (CFSP)">Common foreign and security policy (CFSP)</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organisation)">NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organisation)</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://'New look' NATO">'New look' NATO</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Petersberg tasks">Petersberg tasks</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Western European Union (WEU)">Western European Union (WEU)</A><BR><BR>
European Union agencies	These are public authorities set up under European law and enjoying legal personality, which have been set up by an instrument of Community secondary legislation to carry out a specific technical, scientific or administrative task.<BR><BR>The first agencies were set up in the 1970s but most of them started work in 1994 or 1995, following the decision of the Brussels European Council (October 1993) on the siting of the headquarters of seven of them. The most recent agencies are the European Food Safety Authority (January 2002), the European Maritime Safety Agency (August 2002) and the European Aviation Safety Agency (September 2002).<BR><BR>Fifteen bodies currently meet the definition of Community agency, even though a variety of terms are used to describe them (centre, foundation, agency, office, etc.). <BR>As autonomous organisations, the agencies are a heterogeneous group united by a single organisational model. Depending on their mandates and their partners or clients, the agencies can be divided into four sub-groups based on their activities:<BR><BR>The agencies facilitating the operation of the internal market:<BR><BR>- OHIM (Office for Harmonisation in the Internal Market (Trade Marks and Designs)), with its headquarters in Alicante;<BR>- CPVO (Community Plant Variety Office), with its headquarters in Angers;<BR>- EMEA (European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products), with its headquarters in London;<BR>- EFSA (European Food Safety Authority), with provisional headquarters in Brussels;<BR>- EMSA (European Maritime Safety Agency), (location yet to be decided);<BR>- EASA (European Aviation Safety Agency), (location yet to be decided).<BR><BR>Monitoring Centres:<BR><BR>- EEA (European Environment Agency), with its headquarters in Copenhagen;<BR>- EMCDDA (European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction), with its headquarters in Lisbon;<BR>- EUMC (European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia), with its headquarters in Vienna.<BR><BR>Agencies promoting social dialogue at European level:<BR><BR>- CEDEFOP (European Centre for the development of vocational training), with its headquarters in Salonika;<BR>- European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions (Dublin);<BR>- European Agency for Safety and Health at Work (Bilbao).<BR><BR>Agencies carrying out programmes and tasks on behalf of the European Union in their respective areas of expertise:<BR><BR>- ETF (European Training Foundation), with its headquarters in Turin;<BR><BR>- CdT (Translation Centre for Bodies in the European Union), with its headquarters in Luxembourg;<BR><BR>- ERA (European Reconstruction Agency), with its headquarters in Salonika.<BR><BR>See also: <BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Education, vocational training and youth">Education, vocational training and youth</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Fight against drugs">Fight against drugs</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Fight against racism and xenophobia">Fight against racism and xenophobia</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Food safety">Food safety</A><BR><BR>
European arrest warrant	The European arrest warrant is a judicial decision issued by a Member State with a view to the arrest and surrender by another Member State of a person being sought for a criminal prosecution or a custodial sentence.<BR><BR>It is a tool designed to strengthen cooperation between the judicial authorities of the Member States by eliminating the use of extradition. It is based on the principle of mutual recognition of decisions in criminal matters.<BR><BR>The European arrest warrant is based on a Framework Decision adopted by the Council on 13 June 2002. This decision must be applied from 1 January 2004 but a number of States have decided to bring forward the date of entry into force to 2003.<BR><BR>See also:<BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Area of freedom, security and justice">Area of freedom, security and justice</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Decision and framework decision (EU Treaty, Title VI)">Decision and framework decision (EU Treaty, Title VI)</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Justice and Home Affairs (JHA)">Justice and Home Affairs (JHA)</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters">Police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters</A><BR><BR>
European political cooperation (EPC)|EPC|European political cooperation	European political cooperation (EPC) was introduced informally in 1970 (in response to the Davignon report) and formalised by the Single European Act with effect from 1987. The object is consultations between the Member States in foreign policy matters. The Member States have regard for the views of the European Parliament and wherever possible take common positions in international organisations. EPC was superseded by the common foreign and security policy. <BR><BR>See:<BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Common foreign and security policy (CFSP)">Common foreign and security policy (CFSP)</A> <BR><BR>
European security and defence identity	The idea of developing a European defence identity has been prompted by two considerations:<BR><BR>For some years now Europe has been faced with the emergence of several hotbeds of instability in the eastern half of the continent, such as Bosnia and Herzegovina or Kosovo. <BR><BR>The relative decline in the United States' European defence commitment has left a void which Europe has not succeeded in filling. The last few years have consequently served to emphasise the limitations of an alliance (NATO) which defines itself primarily in relation to an external threat. At the same time there is a growing realisation of the need for a political entity motivated by an awareness of shared interests to face up to the new security challenges in Europe. <BR><BR>Against this background, the NATO Council held in Brussels in January 1994 recognised the importance of defining a specifically European identity in relation to security and defence. The first steps towards this were taken at the NATO Council held in Berlin on 3 June 1996 with the development of the concept of Combined Joint Task Forces (CJTF), to which the ministers of the Alliance subscribed at the January 1994 summit as a means of using NATO's military capacity in operations led by the Western European Union (WEU) under its political control and strategic management. <BR><BR>Since then, the European Union has set up its own permanent political and military structures for the political control and strategic management of crises. In December 2002, within the framework of the permanent arrangements for EU-NATO cooperation and consultation known as "Berlin Plus", the Union and NATO signed a strategic partnership agreement on crisis management. Through this agreement, the Union will have access with immediate effect to NATO's logistical and planning resources, including information. The EU will therefore be able to use these resources to implement its own peace-keeping operations and to set up in 2003 a rapid reaction force that will eventually comprise 60 000 men.<BR><BR>See:<BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organisation)">NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organisation)</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://'New look' NATO">'New look' NATO</A> <BR>•<A HREF="bword://Western European Union (WEU)">Western European Union (WEU)</A> <BR><BR>
Europol (European Police Office)|European Police Office|Europol	Europol is referred to in Article 29 of the Treaty of Amsterdam, as a means of providing citizens with a high level of safety within an area of freedom, security and justice.<BR><BR>The idea of a European Police Office was first raised at the Luxembourg European Council on 28 and 29 June 1991. The plan then was to set up a new body which would provide a structure for developing police cooperation between Member States in preventing and combating serious forms of international organised crime. Provision for the Office was made in the Treaty of Maastricht, and it began its activities on 3 January 1994 as the Europol Drugs Unit (EDU). This initially confined its efforts to the fight against drugs, but its terms of reference were gradually extended to other serious crimes.<BR><BR>The Convention establishing Europol was signed in July 1995 and entered into force on 1 October 1998, but only became fully operational on 1 July 1999. Europol took over the activities of the EDU, for example in the areas of drug trafficking, clandestine immigration networks, trafficking in stolen vehicles, trafficking in human beings (including child pornography), counterfeiting currency and falsification of other means of payment, trafficking in radioactive and nuclear substances, terrorism and money-laundering. <BR><BR>The Treaty of Amsterdam conferred a number of different tasks on Europol: coordinating and implementing specific investigations conducted by the Member States' authorities, developing specialised expertise in order to help Member States in their investigations into organised crime, and establishing contacts with prosecutors and investigators who specialise in the fight against organised crime.<BR><BR>Europol's role was enhanced in December 2001 when its remit was extended to all forms of international crime as defined in the annex to the Europol Convention. Two more fundamental suggestions were also made, concerning the possibility of giving Europol genuine powers of investigation and ways of exercising democratic control over the Office. <BR><BR>See:<BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Area of freedom, security and justice">Area of freedom, security and justice</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Convention (Title VI of the EU Treaty)">Convention (Title VI of the EU Treaty)</A> <BR>•<A HREF="bword://Fight against drugs">Fight against drugs</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Fight against international organised crime">Fight against international organised crime</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Fight against terrorism">Fight against terrorism</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Justice and Home Affairs (JHA)">Justice and Home Affairs (JHA)</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Measures to combat money-laundering">Measures to combat money-laundering</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters">Police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters</A><BR><BR>
External responsibilities of the European Community	The European Community's external responsibilities are defined in accordance with whether they are conferred on the Community or on the Member States. They are described as "exclusive" where they are exercised entirely by the Community (e.g. the common agricultural policy) and "mixed" where they are shared with the Member States (e.g. the transport policy).<BR><BR>The distinction has been defined in Court of Justice case law and is based on the principle of implicit responsibility, whereby external responsibility derives from the existence of internal responsibility. The Treaty confers explicit responsibility in only two cases: commercial policy (Article 133, formerly Article 113) and association agreements (Article 310, formerly Article 238).<BR><BR>It should be pointed out that the common foreign and security policy comes under the heading of the EU's external relations, which are governed by intergovernmental procedures (second pillar), rather than under the external responsibilities of the European Community.<BR><BR>The growth in the Community's activities (e.g. the completion of the single market), developments in world trade and the less clear-cut case law have made the exercise of external powers more problematic, while at the same time entailing a far-reaching duty to cooperate and coordinate in the name of a united front in international representation.<BR><BR>To enable the Community to adapt to the radical changes in the structures of the world economy and reflect the wide responsibilities given to the World Trade Organisation, the Treaty of Amsterdam has amended Article 133 of the EC Treaty to allow the Council, acting unanimously, to broaden the scope of the common commercial policy to cover international negotiations and agreements on services and intellectual property.<BR><BR>See:<BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Common commercial policy">Common commercial policy</A> <BR>•<A HREF="bword://Common foreign and security policy (CFSP)">Common foreign and security policy (CFSP)</A> <BR>•<A HREF="bword://Pillars of the European Union">Pillars of the European Union</A> <BR><BR>
Fight against drugs	The fight against drugs involves a wide range of activities, chief among them the fight against addiction and illicit trafficking. The specific legal basis for European Union action depends on the type of measure undertaken.<BR><BR>Preventing drug addiction comes under Article 152 of the EC Treaty (public health - former Article 129). Measures taken by the Community on this basis include a new action programme for 2003-08.<BR><BR>Responsibility for combating illicit drug trafficking rests with the Europol Drugs Unit, which has set up an intelligence unit to improve police and customs cooperation between the Member States. On 1 October 1998 the Unit became part of the European Police Office (Europol).<BR><BR>The Treaty of Amsterdam clearly identifies the fight against illicit drug trafficking as one of the objectives of the new Title VI of the EU Treaty (police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters). In 1999 the Commission presented a Communication on a European Union action plan to combat drugs (2000-04). This plan makes the fight against drugs one of the Union's internal and external priorities, and recommends exchanging reliable data and stepping up international cooperation. In December 1999 the Helsinki European Council adopted the Union's drugs strategy (2000-04), based on the Commission Communication. In June 2000 the Feira European Council adopted the Union's action plan on drugs for 2000-04, which translates the strategy into approximately 100 specific measures to be taken by the Member States, the Commission, the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction and Europol.<BR><BR>See:<BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Area of freedom, security and justice">Area of freedom, security and justice</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://European Union Agencies">European Union Agencies</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Europol (European Police Office)">Europol (European Police Office)</A> <BR>•<A HREF="bword://Justice and home affairs (JHA)">Justice and home affairs (JHA)</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters">Police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters</A><BR><BR>
Fight against fraud	The fight against fraud and corruption rests on two separate legal bases, both of which were amended by the Treaty of Amsterdam:<BR><BR>•Article 29 of the EU Treaty calls for "closer cooperation between police forces, customs authorities and other competent authorities in the Member States, both directly and through Europol" in this area; <BR>•Article 280 of the EC Treaty concerns activities affecting the Community's financial interests; here, the Council and the European Parliament have the power to adopt measures under the codecision procedure after consulting the Court of Auditors. <BR><BR>A Convention on the protection of the Community's financial interests, signed on 26 July 1995 on the basis of the third pillar of the EU Treaty, entered into force in October 2002. The aim is to ensure provision in the criminal law of all Member States for an offence of fraud against the Community's financial interests. After 1988, this type of fraud was tackled by the European Commission's fraud prevention task force (UCLAF), replaced in June 1999 by the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF).<BR><BR>In its overall strategic approach (June 2000), the Commission defined a number of general policy objectives relating to the protection of financial interests and combating fraud over the period 2001-05. In May 2001 it adopted an action plan for 2001-03 which aims to realise these objectives. <BR><BR>In its contribution to the Nice Intergovernmental Conference (February 2000) to strengthen Community action on combating fraud, the Commission proposed the introduction of a legal basis in the Treaties for establishing a system of rules on criminal-law proceedings for transnational fraud, and the appointment of a European Public Prosecutor to coordinate investigations and prevent offences involving the Union's financial interests.<BR><BR>This was followed by a Green Paper (December 2001) on criminal-law protection of the financial interests of the Community and the establishment of a European Prosecutor.<BR><BR>See:<BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Justice and home affairs (JHA)">Justice and home affairs (JHA)</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://OLAF (European Anti-fraud Office)">OLAF (European Anti-fraud Office)</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Pillars of the European Union">Pillars of the European Union</A> <BR>•<A HREF="bword://Police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters">Police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters</A><BR><BR>
Fight against international organised crime	Originally, responsibility for combating international crime was given to the Europol Drugs Unit, which exchanges information between Member States to improve police and judicial cooperation. On 1 October 1998, the new European Police Office (Europol) took over the responsibilities of the Drugs Unit, a temporary structure put in place in 1994 pending the entry into force of the Europol Convention.<BR><BR>The fight against international crime was one of the fields included in the new Title VI of the Maastricht Treaty. This explicit reference enabled the Member States to go beyond the mere exchange of information.<BR><BR>During the Amsterdam European Council in June 1997, the political will of the Member States in the fight against organised crime was translated into an action programme setting the European Union's priorities. In addition, a pre-accession pact on organised crime was signed on 28 May 1998 with the candidate countries.<BR><BR>Under the Amsterdam Treaty, one of the Union's objectives is to provide its citizens with a high level of safety within an area of freedom, security and justice. This objective is to be achieved through crime prevention and by combating associated phenomena, including terrorism, trafficking in human beings, crimes against children, drug trafficking, arms trafficking, corruption and fraud. <BR><BR>After the entry into force of the Amsterdam Treaty, the main objectives of the fight against crime were defined at the special European Council meeting held in Tampere in October 1999.<BR><BR>The Nice Treaty provided a basis for action and for the setting up of a unit of public prosecutors, magistrates or national police officers with equivalent powers (Eurojust).<BR><BR>In setting up the European Police Office (Europol), which became operational in June 1999, and Eurojust (following the decision of 28 February 2002), the Member States have established cooperation between their criminal investigation services and judicial authorities so as to combat organised crime effectively. <BR><BR>The Union also takes part in the meetings of a number of international organisations, including the G8, the United Nations, the OECD, the international Financial Action Task Force and the Council of Europe.<BR><BR>See:<BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Europol (European Police Office)">Europol (European Police Office)</A> <BR>•<A HREF="bword://Justice and home affairs (JHA)">Justice and home affairs (JHA)</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Measures to combat money laundering">Measures to combat money laundering</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters">Police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Pre-accession pact on organised crime">Pre-accession pact on organised crime</A><BR><BR>
Fight against racism and xenophobia	Before the entry into force of the Amsterdam Treaty, various measures against racism and xenophobia had been taken within the framework of social policy. For instance, 1997 was declared European Year against Racism. The Commission presented an action plan against racism in March 1998 to consolidate what had been achieved during 1997 and to prepare the ground for the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam. <BR><BR>Since the advent of the Amsterdam Treaty, Article 13 of the Treaty establishing the European Community has provided a basis for combating all forms of discrimination based on sex, racial or ethnic origin, religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation. It was on the basis of this Article that in June 2000 the Council adopted an important directive implementing the principle of equal treatment between persons irrespective of racial or ethnic origin.<BR><BR>In addition to committing itself to the implementation of Article 13, the European Union has pursued its efforts to integrate the fight against racism and xenophobia into all its policies: employment, the European Structural Funds, education, training and youth. Moreover, Article 29 of the Treaty on European Union, inserted by the Amsterdam Treaty, provides a legal basis for the fight against racism and xenophobia in the fields of police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters.<BR><BR>The European Monitoring Centre for Racism and Xenophobia also plays an important role. Set up in Vienna in June 1997, its main task is to observe the scale of racism and xenophobia within the Union and developments in this area, to analyse the reasons for these phenomena and to draw up proposals for presentation to the Community institutions and the Member States. The Monitoring Centre is also responsible for setting up and coordinating a European Racism and Xenophobia Information Network (RAXEN). In addition, an agreement was concluded on 21 December 1998 between the Centre and the Council of Europe in order to step up cooperation between the former and the Council of Europe's Committee on racism and intolerance.<BR><BR>See:<BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Equal opportunities">Equal opportunities</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://European Union Agencies">European Union Agencies</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Human rights">Human rights</A> <BR>•<A HREF="bword://Justice and home affairs (JHA)">Justice and home affairs (JHA)</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Non-discrimination principle">Non-discrimination principle</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters">Police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Social Policy">Social Policy</A><BR><BR>
Fight against terrorism	The European Union has set itself the objective of providing its citizens with a high level of safety within an area of freedom, security and justice. The Amsterdam Treaty inserted a specific reference to terrorism as a serious crime into Article 29 of the Treaty on European Union.<BR><BR>Following the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001 in the United States, the European Council, at an extraordinary meeting on 21 September 2001, adopted an action plan designed to step up police and judicial cooperation, develop international legal instruments, stop the financing of terrorism, strengthen air traffic security and ensure greater consistency between Union policies. At the Laeken European Council of December 2001, a political agreement was reached on two closely linked framework decisions, one relating to the fight against terrorism (adopted on 13 June 2002) and the other to the European arrest warrant (adopted on 13 June 2002).<BR><BR>Although the attacks of 11 September 2001 clearly revealed the inadequacy of traditional forms of judicial and police cooperation and thereby provided the impetus for a series of initiatives, the problem of acts of terrorism had already been raised at the Tampere European Council in 1999 and the European Council at Santa Maria de Feira in 2000. In addition, the European Union had taken a large number of specific measures in preceding years, well before the attacks took place:<BR><BR>•the Europol Convention, which refers to cooperation on the prevention of terrorism and the fight against it (November 1995);<BR>•the Council's Joint Action on the creation and maintenance of a Directory of specialised counter-terrorist competences, skills and expertise (October 1996);<BR>•the Council's Joint Action on the creation of a European Judicial Network with powers in relation to acts of terrorism (June 1998);<BR>•the Council's Joint Action on making it a criminal offence to participate in a criminal organisation in the Member States of the European Union (December 1998); <BR>•the Council decision instructing Europol to deal with crimes committed or likely to be committed in the course of terrorist activities (December 1998);<BR>•the Council recommendation on cooperation in combating the financing of terrorist groups (December 1999);<BR>•the Council decision of 28 February 2002 setting up Eurojust (on the basis of the Nice Treaty) with a view to reinforcing the fight against serious crime (including the fight against terrorism). <BR><BR>Moreover, all the Member States are signatories to a number of international conventions and protocols on acts of terrorism drawn up under the auspices of the United Nations and the Council of Europe, such as the Council of Europe's European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism (January 1977).<BR><BR>See:<BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Area of freedom, security and justice">Area of freedom, security and justice</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://European Arrest Warrant">European Arrest Warrant</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://European Judicial Network in criminal matters (EJN)">European Judicial Network in criminal matters (EJN)</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Europol (European Police Office)">Europol (European Police Office)</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Justice and home affairs (JHA)">Justice and home affairs (JHA)</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters">Police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters</A><BR><BR>
Financial perspective 2000-2006	The financial perspective forms the framework for Community expenditure over a period of several years. It is the product of an interinstitutional agreement between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission and indicates the maximum volume and the composition of the foreseeable Community expenditure. It is adjusted annually by the Commission to take account of prices and the development of Community GNP. However, it should be noted that the financial perspective is not a multi-annual budget, since the annual budgetary procedure remains essential to determine the actual amount of expenditure and the breakdown between the different budget headings. <BR><BR>To date, three interinstitutional agreements of this type have been concluded, the first in 1988, the second in 1992 and the third in 1999:<BR><BR>•the 1988-1992 financial perspective (Delors I package);<BR>•the 1993-1999 financial perspective (Delors II package);<BR>•the 2000-2006 financial perspective.<BR><BR>The financial perspective 2000-2006 is part of the new Interinstitutional Agreement which is the cornerstone of the Agenda 2000 financial package. This Agreement, which received political endorsement at the Berlin summit in March 1999, should enable the Union to take in new members and at the same time strengthen its policies while keeping to a rigorous financial framework.<BR><BR>The financial perspective establishes the reference framework for a period of seven years (2000-2006). Although it cannot incorporate expenditure linked to new accessions before they take effect, it does, nonetheless, have three features that are interesting in terms of enlargement:<BR><BR>•agricultural funding is extended to encompass a new rural development policy, veterinary measures, a pre-accession agricultural instrument, and a margin left available for enlargement;<BR>•the allocation for the Structural Funds destined for the fifteen Member States will be gradually reduced from 2002 onwards by concentrating the priorities on a more limited number of regions. Structural operations also comprise a new pre-accession instrument;<BR>•the amount allocated for external action is increased by 2% per year so as to cover the increase in pre-accession aid under the Phare programme. In addition, the allocations provided for pre-accession aid (Phare, Ispa and Sapard) will remain unchanged irrespective of the number of applicant countries which will become members of the European Union during the period 2000-2006.

Food safety	The European Union has made food safety one of the main priorities of the European policy agenda. It is a horizontal objective to be taken into account in several areas of Community competence: the CAP and its rural development pillar, the environment, public health, consumer protection and the internal market.<BR><BR>The public debate initiated by the Green Paper on the general principles of food safety led in January 2000 to the publication of the White Paper that marks an important step in the adoption of new food law. In this document, the Commission announced the development of a legal framework covering the entire food chain - "from the farm to the fork" - in accordance with a global, integrated approach. According to this logic, food safety relates to: animal feed and animal health, animal protection and welfare, veterinary checks, animal health measures, plant health checks, the preparation and hygiene of foodstuffs. The White Paper also stresses the need to initiate ongoing dialogue with consumers so as to inform them, educate them and listen to them.<BR><BR>Adopted in February 2002, the regulation forming the basis for the new food safety legislation defines five fundamental general principles: <BR><BR>•an affirmation of the integrated nature of the food chain; <BR>•risk analysis as the cornerstone of this policy;<BR>•the responsibility of operators in the sector;<BR>•the traceability of products at every stage of the food chain;<BR>•citizens' right to clear and accurate information. <BR><BR>It also founded the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), whose main tasks are to provide independent scientific opinions on food safety issues, to collect and analyse data on any potential or emerging risk and to maintain an ongoing dialogue with the public.<BR><BR>See: <BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Animal welfare">Animal welfare</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Common agricultural policy (CAP)">Common agricultural policy (CAP)</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Consumer protection">Consumer protection</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Environment">Environment</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://European Union agencies">European Union agencies</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Genetically modified organisms (GMOs)">Genetically modified organisms (GMOs)</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Precautionary principle">Precautionary principle</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Public health">Public health</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Rural development">Rural development</A><BR><BR>
Free movement of persons (visas, asylum, immigration and other policies)|Free movement of persons	The Treaty of Amsterdam has written a new Title IV into the EC Treaty. It covers the following fields:<BR><BR>•free movement of persons;<BR>•controls on external borders;<BR>•asylum, immigration and safeguarding the rights of third-country nationals;<BR>•judicial cooperation in civil matters.<BR><BR>These fields used to come under Title VI of the EU Treaty (Justice and home affairs), but now the Treaty of Amsterdam has "communitised" them, in other words, brought them under the legal framework of the first pillar.<BR>During a five-year transition period following the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam:<BR><BR>•the Commission shares the right of initiative with the Member States; <BR>•the Council acts unanimously (except for certain rules on visas) after consulting the European Parliament;<BR>•the Court has jurisdiction in accordance with the rules of the EC Treaty (apart from a few exceptions under Article 62, point 1).<BR><BR>After this five-year period:<BR><BR>•the Commission will have sole right of initiative;<BR>•the Council will be able to decide unanimously, after consulting the European Parliament, on the application of qualified-majority voting and the codecision procedure;<BR>•however, the transition to qualified-majority voting and to the codecision procedure will be automatic (without a unanimous vote by the Council) for the issuing of visas and the rules concerning the uniform visa.<BR><BR>The Treaty of Nice has extended the scope of this automatic transition from unanimous to qualified-majority voting. First, qualified-majority voting applies from the entry into force of the Treaty of Nice in the fields of asylum and refugees (on condition that Community legislation has been adopted) and of judicial cooperation in civil matters with a cross-border dimension, except for aspects involving family law. Second, qualified-majority voting will apply from 1 May 2004 (in accordance with the five-year transition period) to measures concerning the free movement of nationals of non-member countries on the territory of the Member States for a maximum period of three months, illegal immigration, and administrative cooperation on the free movement of persons. <BR><BR>On the basis of the Treaty of Amsterdam, the United Kingdom and Ireland have opted out of measures taken under Title IV. Denmark will participate only in measures relating to visas.See:<BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Area of freedom, security and justice">Area of freedom, security and justice</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Communitisation">Communitisation</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Community " bridge" (Title VI of the EU Treaty) ">Community "bridge" (Title VI of the EU Treaty) </A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Justice and home affairs (JHA)">Justice and home affairs (JHA)</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Opting out">Opting out</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Pillars of the Union">Pillars of the Union</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Title VI of the EU Treaty">Title VI of the EU Treaty</A><BR><BR>
General-interest services	"General-interest services" are services considered to be in the general interest by the public authorities and accordingly subjected to specific public-service obligations. They include non-market services (e.g. compulsory education, social protection), obligations of the State (e.g. security and justice) and services of general economic interest (e.g. energy and communications). Article 86 of the Treaty (former Article 90) does not apply to the first two categories (non-market services and state obligations).<BR><BR>See:<BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Public service">Public service</A> <BR>•<A HREF="bword://Public service charter">Public service charter</A> <BR>•<A HREF="bword://Services of general economic interest">Services of general economic interest</A> <BR>•<A HREF="bword://Universal service">Universal service</A><BR><BR>
Genetically modified organisms (GMOs)|GMOs|Genetically modified organisms	GMOs are organisms whose genetic material (DNA) has been altered not by reproduction and/or natural recombination but by the introduction of a modified gene or a gene from another variety or species.<BR><BR>There has been Community legislation on GMOs since the early 1990s. EU action is designed to protect human health and the environment while following the rules of the single market. The Union has legislated on the use, dissemination, marketing and traceability of GMOs. It has also adopted measures to implement the provisions on transboundary movements of GMOs laid down in the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety.<BR><BR>The European Commission is questioning the de facto moratorium on the marketing and production of GMOs within the Union, introduced in 1999 by the Member States. It is examining the possibility of authorising GMOs once again, while taking account of the precautionary principle, in order not to penalise European industry, agriculture and research.<BR><BR>See:<BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Consumer protection">Consumer protection</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Environment">Environment</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Food safety">Food safety</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Precautionary principle">Precautionary principle</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Sustainable development">Sustainable development</A><BR><BR>
Globalisation of the economy	The phenomenon of economic globalisation was identified by the Turin European Council as one of the major challenges facing the European Union at the end of the 20th century. The term refers to a process of growing economic integration worldwide, and the main driving forces behind it are:<BR><BR>•the liberalisation of international trade and capital movements;<BR>•accelerating technological progress and the advent of the information society;<BR>•deregulation.<BR><BR>These three factors accentuate each other: technological progress stimulates international trade and worldwide patterns of trade allow for more effective dissemination of technological progress. At the same time, deregulation stimulates the development of new forms of technology and contributes to removing barriers to trade. Some observers, however, blame technological progress for enabling businesses and individuals to find a way round national regulations more easily.
Governance	The debate on European governance, launched by the Commission in its White Paper of July 2001, concerns all the rules, procedures and practices affecting how powers are exercised within the European Union. The aim is to adopt new forms of governance that bring the Union closer to European citizens, make it more effective, reinforce democracy in Europe and consolidate the legitimacy of the institutions. The Union must reform itself in order to fill the democratic deficit of its institutions. This governance should lie in the framing and implementation of better and more consistent policies associating civil society organisations and the European institutions. It also entails improving the quality of European legislation, making it clearer and more effective. Moreover, the European Union must contribute to the debate on world governance and play an important role in improving the operation of international institutions.<BR><BR>See: <BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Community and intergovernmental methods">Community and intergovernmental methods</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Debate on the future of the European Union">Debate on the future of the European Union</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Democratic deficit">Democratic deficit</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://European Convention">European Convention</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Institutional balance and democratic legitimacy">Institutional balance and democratic legitimacy</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Laeken Declaration ">Laeken Declaration </A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Simplification of legislation ">Simplification of legislation </A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Treaty of Nice">Treaty of Nice</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Transparency (access to documents) ">Transparency (access to documents) </A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Transparency of Council proceedings">Transparency of Council proceedings</A><BR><BR>
Green Paper	Commission Green Papers are documents intended to stimulate debate and launch a process of consultation at European level on a particular topic (such as social policy, the single currency, telecommunications). These consultations may then lead to the publication of a White Paper, translating the conclusions of the debate into practical proposals for Community action.<BR><BR>See:<BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://European Commission">European Commission</A> <BR>•<A HREF="bword://White Paper">White Paper</A><BR><BR>
Hard core	This refers to a small group of countries able and willing to enter into closer cooperation with one another. This concept has to be seen in the wider context of flexibility, which should see differentiated integration enshrined in the institutional framework of the Union to prevent hard cores from forming outside this framework (as was the case with the Schengen area).<BR><BR>See:<BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Closer cooperation">Closer cooperation</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Schengen">Schengen</A> <BR><BR>
Hierarchy of Community acts (hierarchy of norms)|Hierarchy of Community acts|hierarchy of norms	A declaration annexed to the Treaty on European Union states that "it might be possible to review the classification of Community acts with a view to establishing an appropriate hierarchy between the different categories of act".<BR><BR>The main purpose of such a hierarchy would be to enable the lawmaking authority to concentrate on policy aspects of particular issues rather than on questions of detail. It would dictate the shape of the Community decision-making process by ensuring that instruments of constitutional status were subject to more restrictive procedures (such as adoption by unanimous vote, augmented qualified majority, and assent) than legislative instruments, which are themselves subject to less flexible procedures (for example, the codecision procedure) than implementing instruments (for instance, the institutionalised delegation of powers to the Commission).<BR><BR>The subject was addressed in 1990 in the early discussions on the possibility of incorporating the codecision procedure into the Treaty. The underlying idea was to avoid an over-rigorous procedure being applied to certain acts of secondary importance and thereby prevent the legislative machinery becoming congested. In 1991, during the negotiations on the Treaty of Maastricht, the Commission proposed introducing a hierarchy of norms and a new system for classifying Community instruments (treaties, laws, secondary or implementing acts), but failed to overcome the problems posed by the different national legal traditions. The subject has been raised again in the European Convention, which was set up in December 2001 with the task of drafting a Constitution for Europe that would form the apex of the pyramid of Community acts. <BR><BR>See:<BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Assent procedure">Assent procedure</A> <BR>•<A HREF="bword://Codecision procedure ">Codecision procedure </A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Community legal instruments">Community legal instruments</A> <BR>•<A HREF="bword://Consultation procedure ">Consultation procedure </A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Cooperation procedure ">Cooperation procedure </A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://European Convention">European Convention</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Qualified majority">Qualified majority</A> <BR>•<A HREF="bword://Reinforced qualified majority">Reinforced qualified majority</A> <BR>•<A HREF="bword://Unanimity">Unanimity</A><BR><BR>
High Representative for the CFSP (Mr/Ms CFSP)|High Representative for the CFSP|Mr CFSP|Ms CFSP	A new position of High Representative for the common foreign and security policy (CFSP) was created by the Treaty of Amsterdam. The post is held by the Secretary-General of the Council, whose task is to assist the presidency of the Union in matters relating to the common foreign and security policy. The holder of the post is also known as "Mr/Ms CFSP". The High Representative aims to allow the Union to express itself with greater visibility and coherence on the international stage by giving it a more recognisable face and voice.<BR><BR>The High Representative also helps in formulating, preparing and implementing policy decisions by the Council. He or she may conduct political dialogue with third parties, on the Council's behalf and at the request of the Presidency.<BR><BR>Responsibility for running the Council's General Secretariat now rests with the Deputy Secretary-General.<BR><BR>See:<BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Common foreign and security policy (CFSP)">Common foreign and security policy (CFSP)</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Council of the European Union">Council of the European Union</A><BR><BR>
Human rights	The case law of the Court of Justice of the European Union recognises the principles laid down in the Council of Europe's Convention on Human Rights. This respect for human rights was confirmed by the Member States in the preamble to the 1986 Single Act and later incorporated into Article 6 (former Article F) of the EU Treaty, which is based on the above Convention and the shared constitutional traditions of the Member States.<BR><BR>The guarantee of respect for fundamental rights has been further strengthened by the Treaty of Amsterdam, which has extended the jurisdiction of the Court of Justice to cover respect for the rights deriving from Article 6 with regard to action by the Union institutions. At the same time, a new suspension clause lays down what action is to be taken in cases where a Member State seriously and persistently breaches the principles on which the Union is founded.<BR><BR>See:<BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Charter of Fundamental Rights">Charter of Fundamental Rights</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://European Convention on Human Rights">European Convention on Human Rights</A> <BR>•<A HREF="bword://Suspension clause">Suspension clause</A>
Humanitarian aid	The European Union as a whole (the Commission and the Member States) is currently one of the largest donors of humanitarian aid in the world.<BR><BR>The humanitarian aid dimension of the European Community's external action has become very important in recent years due to the increase in the number of crises throughout the world and the Community's willingness to take on a leading role in international humanitarian efforts.<BR><BR>Therefore, in 1992, the European Commission's Humanitarian Aid Office (ECHO) was established. ECHO's mandate is to provide emergency assistance and relief (in the form of goods and services) to victims of natural or man-made disasters or conflicts outside the Union. This aid is based on the principles of non-discrimination, impartiality and humanity. It is distributed by ECHO's partners, namely non-governmental organisations, humanitarian agencies of the United Nations and other international organisations.<BR><BR>See:<BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Development aid">Development aid</A><BR><BR>
Incorporation of the Community acquis	The Essen European Council (December 1994) called on the Commission to present a White Paper on the preparation of the associated countries of Central and Eastern Europe for integration into the Union's internal market. The White Paper, which was presented at the Cannes European Council in June 1995, contained an indicative programme for the alignment of the Central and Eastern European countries' legislation with that of the internal market. It provided that these countries would establish priorities in order to incorporate the Community rules and that they would be helped in this work by a technical assistance office (TAIEX), particularly in order to obtain information on Community legislation.<BR><BR>The incorporation and implementation of all Community legislation are the main challenges which the applicant countries face. They require the administrations and the legal systems to be strengthened, and the infrastructure of the applicant countries to be drastically adapted to conform to Community standards, particularly on environmental questions, transport, energy and telecommunications. To facilitate these considerable adjustments, pre-accession aid is provided to the applicant countries.<BR><BR>The accession negotiations for the applicant countries began in March 1998. The first step was to evaluate each applicant country's legislation for compatibility with the Community rules (screening process). This evaluation then constituted the basis for the second stage, bilateral negotiations between the Union and each applicant.<BR><BR>In some areas, the applicant countries have been granted transition periods between their accession and the time when they are capable of fully implementing the Community <I>acquis</I>. However, any such transition periods are limited in their scope and duration and subject to very strict conditions.<BR><BR>See:<BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Accession negotiations">Accession negotiations</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Applicant countries">Applicant countries</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Community acquis">Community acquis</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Enlargement">Enlargement</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://European Conference">European Conference</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Pre-accession aid">Pre-accession aid</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Programme of Community aid to the countries of Central and Eastern Europe (Phare)">Programme of Community aid to the countries of Central and Eastern Europe (Phare)</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Screening">Screening</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://TAIEX (Technical Assistance Information Exchange Office)">TAIEX (Technical Assistance Information Exchange Office)</A><BR><BR>
Information Society	The information society is synonymous with what is meant by "new information and communication technologies" (ICT). Since the beginning of the 90s, the new ICT have been booming. The universal use of electronic exchanges of information, convergence towards digital technologies, the exponential growth of the Internet and the opening up of telecommunications markets are all signs of this change.<BR><BR>The information society is revolutionising many areas of everyday life, particularly access to training and knowledge (distance learning, e-learning related services), work organisation and mobilisation of skills (teleworking, virtual companies), practical life (e-health services) and leisure. It is also providing new opportunities in terms of participation of citizens by making it easier to express opinions and points of view. However, these positive advances go hand-in-hand with new concerns: mass use of the Internet means that steps have to be taken against new criminal behaviour, pirating, and questions of protection of personal data and intellectual property. Moreover, the information society may contribute to the marginalisation of certain sections of society by emphasising social inequalities.<BR><BR>In the light of these potential benefits and threats, the European Union has placed the information society at the heart of its strategy for the 21st century. Among other things it has launched a series of support and promotion actions (eEurope action plan) and adopted measures aimed at controlling and limiting the risks associated with the development of the information society such as an action plan aimed at promoting safe use of the Internet and combating unlawful and harmful messages.<BR><BR>See:<BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://eEurope">eEurope</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Intellectual property">Intellectual property</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Telecommunications">Telecommunications</A><BR><BR>
Institutional balance	The principle of Community institutional balance means that each institution has to act in accordance with the powers conferred on it by the Treaties. The principle itself is not set out in so many words in the Treaties but derives from a judgment by the Court of Justice of the European Union thus proscribing any encroachment by one institution on the powers conferred on another. It is the Court's responsibility to ensure that this principle is respected.<BR><BR>The relationship between the Commission, the Council and the European Parliament is governed by the idea of the "institutional triangle". Their relationship and the powers conferred on them by the Treaties have changed radically over the years, particularly in the case of Parliament, whose influence has increased considerably. Despite the progress made by the Treaty on European Union and the Treaty of Amsterdam, there is still an imbalance between the legislative powers of the Council and those of Parliament, since legislative power is only really shared by the two institutions in the areas covered by codecision.<BR><BR>The Convention, whose task it is to draw up proposals for a fundamental reform of the Union, has to strike a new balance between the institutions (especially between the Commission and the Council) and possibly extend the codecision procedure. The aim of these measures is to combat the democratic deficit currently afflicting the Union.<BR><BR>See:<BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Codecision procedure">Codecision procedure</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Council of the European Union ">Council of the European Union </A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Democratic deficit">Democratic deficit</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://European Commission">European Commission</A> <BR>•<A HREF="bword://European Convention">European Convention</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://European Parliament">European Parliament</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Governance">Governance</A><BR><BR>
Intellectual property	Like tangible goods, intellectual creations can constitute property which is designated "intellectual property". Intellectual property traditionally covers two areas:<BR><BR>•industrial property which mainly comprises patents, designs and models, manufacturers and service brands and protected designations of origin;<BR>•copyright and related rights which apply to all literary and artistic works.<BR><BR>This field covers cultural, social and technological issues of great importance which have to be taken into account when drawing up a coherent policy in this area. Thus, on the question of industrial property, Community regulations have endeavoured to harmonise the conditions for the registration of trademarks and extend to holders the protection conferred by a single set of rules. A Regulation introducing a Community design was also adopted in December 2001. In order to encourage innovation, the Union is also working on the creation of a Community patent.<BR><BR>On the question of copyright and related rights, harmonised Community legislation was drawn up in areas where legal uncertainty was likely to dissuade holders from exploiting rights in certain territories (computer programmes and databases, satellite broadcasting and cable retransmission, rental right and lending right and certain related rights). European legislation was then adapted to take account of the new challenges posed by technological progress and the information society. Measures aimed at combating counterfeiting and piracy have moreover been taken at European level.<BR><BR>See:<BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Information society">Information society</A><BR><BR>
Intergovernmental Conference (IGC)|IGC|Intergovernmental Conference	This term is used to describe negotiations between the Member States' governments with a view to amending the Treaties. Intergovernmental conferences play a major part in European integration, since institutional changes must always be the outcome of such negotiations.<BR><BR>These conferences are convened, at the initiative of a Member State or the Commission, by the Council of Ministers acting by a simple majority (after consulting the European Parliament and, if appropriate, the Commission).<BR><BR>The preparatory work is entrusted to a group consisting of a representative of each of the Member States' governments and, as a matter of custom, a representative of the Commission. The European Parliament is closely involved throughout by means of observers and discussions with the President of the Parliament. This group regularly reports to the General Affairs Council. The final decisions are taken by the heads of state and government at a European Council.<BR><BR>The most important IGCs in recent years have resulted in the following treaties:<BR><BR>•The Single European Act (1986): this introduced the changes needed to complete the internal market on 1 January 1993.<BR>•The Treaty of Maastricht (1992): the Treaty on European Union was negotiated at two separate IGCs, one on economic and monetary union (EMU) and the other on political union, instituting the common foreign and security policy (CFSP) and cooperation on justice and home affairs (JHA).<BR>•The Treaty of Amsterdam (1997): this is the result of the IGC launched at the Turin European Council in March 1996. The task of the Conference was to revise those provisions of the Maastricht Treaty which gave rise to problems of implementation and to prepare for future enlargement.<BR><BR>Since the Treaty of Amsterdam did not introduce all the institutional reforms needed to ensure that the institutions would function efficiently after enlargement, the Cologne European Council (3-4 June 1999) decided that a new IGC should convene in 2000 to address the issues not resolved in the Treaty of Amsterdam.<BR><BR>These were:<BR><BR>•the size and composition of the Commission;<BR>•the weighting of votes in the Council;<BR>•the possible extension of qualified majority voting in the Council. <BR><BR>The Santa Maria de Feira European Council in June 2000 extended the remit of the IGC to include "closer cooperation".<BR><BR>The new IGC was launched on 15 February 2000 after formal consultation of the Commission and the European Parliament.<BR><BR>It was concluded at the Nice European Council (7-10 December 2000) and gave rise to the treaty of the same name signed on 26 February 2001.<BR><BR>A declaration on the future of the Union annexed to the Treaty of Nice refers to a new IGC, to be held in 2004 following a broad public debate and preparation by a Convention on institutional reform. The Convention was established by the Laeken European Council in December 2001 and is to report on its work in June 2003, as a starting point for the IGC negotiations.<BR><BR>See:<BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Council of the European Union">Council of the European Union</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Debate on the future of the European Union">Debate on the future of the European Union</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://European Commission">European Commission</A> <BR>•<A HREF="bword://European Convention">European Convention</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://European Parliament">European Parliament</A> <BR>•<A HREF="bword://Laeken Declaration">Laeken Declaration</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Revision of the Treaties">Revision of the Treaties</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Treaty of Amsterdam">Treaty of Amsterdam</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Treaty of Nice">Treaty of Nice</A><BR><BR>
Ioannina compromise	The Ioannina compromise takes its name from an informal meeting of foreign ministers in the Greek city of Ioannina on 29 March 1994. Among the decisions taken at the meeting was a Council decision concerning the specific question of qualified majority voting in an enlarged 16-member Community. The decision was later adjusted in the light of Norway's decision not to join. The resulting compromise lays down that if members of the Council representing between 23 votes (the old blocking minority threshold) and 26 votes (the new threshold) express their intention of opposing the taking of a decision by the Council by qualified majority, the Council will do all within its power, within a reasonable space of time, to reach a satisfactory solution that can be adopted by at least 65 votes out of 87.<BR><BR>Following the re-weighting of votes in the Council of Ministers, the Treaty of Nice puts an end to the Ioannina compromise. <BR><BR>See:<BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Council of the European Union ">Council of the European Union </A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Qualified majority">Qualified majority</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Treaty of Nice">Treaty of Nice</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Weighting of votes in the Council">Weighting of votes in the Council</A>
Joint action (CFSP)|CFSP|Joint action	This term, which refers to a legal instrument under Title V of the Treaty on European Union, means coordinated action by the Member States whereby resources of all kinds (human resources, know-how, financing, equipment and so on) are mobilised to attain specific objectives fixed by the Council on the base of general guidelines from the European Council.<BR><BR>See:<BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Common foreign and security policy (CFSP)">Common foreign and security policy (CFSP)</A> <BR>•<A HREF="bword://Title VI of the EU Treaty (CFSP)">Title VI of the EU Treaty (CFSP)</A><BR><BR>
Joint action (Justice and home affairs)|Joint action|Justice and home affairs	Joint action was a legal instrument under former Title VI of the EU Treaty that was used between 1993 to 1999. It meant coordinated action by the Member States on behalf of the Union or within the EU framework in cases where, owing to the scale or effects of the envisaged action, the Union's objectives could be attained more effectively by joint action than by the Member States acting individually. It has been abolished by the Treaty of Amsterdam and replaced by "decisions" and "framework decisions".<BR><BR>See:<BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Decision and framework decision (Title VI of the EU Treaty)">Decision and framework decision (Title VI of the EU Treaty)</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://European Judicial Network in criminal matters (EJN)">European Judicial Network in criminal matters (EJN)</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Justice and home affairs (JHA)">Justice and home affairs (JHA)</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Title VI of the EU Treaty">Title VI of the EU Treaty</A><BR><BR>
Joint position (Title VI of the EU Treaty)|Joint position|Title VI of the EU Treaty	The joint position was introduced by the Treaty of Maastricht under the heading of cooperation in the fields of justice and home affairs. The Treaty of Amsterdam retains this instrument in the new Title VI of the EU Treaty (police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters).<BR><BR>The joint position is a legal instrument enabling the Council to define the Union's approach on any specific issue.

Justice and home affairs (JHA)|JHA|Justice and home affairs	Cooperation on justice and home affairs was institutionalised under Title VI of the EU Treaty (also known as the "third pillar"). The aim of this cooperation was to give practical effect to the principle of the free movement of persons. It covered the following:<BR><BR>•asylum policy; <BR>•rules governing the crossing of the external borders of the Member States; <BR>•immigration policy; <BR>•combating drugs; <BR>•combating international fraud; <BR>•judicial cooperation in civil and criminal matters; <BR>•customs cooperation; <BR>•police cooperation. <BR><BR>Various instruments were created as a means of taking action in this sphere: the joint action, the joint position and the convention. Although significant progress has been made, the overall record of cooperation in this field has been criticised. Consensus has been reached on the need to introduce more effective provisions in order to strengthen the cooperation structures and incorporate into the Community framework the areas mentioned above which are linked to controls on persons (asylum, immigration and crossing of external borders).<BR><BR>The Treaty of Amsterdam reorganised cooperation in the fields of justice and home affairs and set as its objective the establishment of an area of freedom, security and justice. Certain sectors were brought within the Community framework, while at the same time new fields and methods emerged.<BR><BR>The "Schengen area", which was formed outside the legal framework of the European Union on the initiative of some of the Member States that wished to advance even further as regards the free movement of persons, will ultimately be incorporated in the EU and EC Treaties.<BR><BR>The Treaty of Nice extends qualified majority voting to certain areas of justice and home affairs that have been brought within the Community framework, such as the free movement of persons. Third pillar issues, however, still require unanimity. In addition, the amendments introduced by the Nice Treaty have made the procedure for enhanced cooperation in the third pillar less restrictive than it used to be. Finally, cooperation in judicial matters has been stepped up in order to create a basis for action and for the creation of Eurojust in the EU Treaty.<BR><BR>See:<BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Area of freedom, security and justice">Area of freedom, security and justice</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Article 36 Committee (Title VI of the EU Treaty)">Article 36 Committee (Title VI of the EU Treaty)</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Closer cooperation">Closer cooperation</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Communitisation">Communitisation</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Community " bridge" (Title VI of the EU Treaty)">Community "bridge" (Title VI of the EU Treaty)</A> <BR>•<A HREF="bword://Convention (Title VI of the EU Treaty)">Convention (Title VI of the EU Treaty)</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://European Judicial Network in criminal matters (EJN)">European Judicial Network in criminal matters (EJN)</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Europol (European Police Office)">Europol (European Police Office)</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Free movement of persons (visas, asylum, immigration and other policies) ">Free movement of persons (visas, asylum, immigration and other policies) </A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Joint action (Justice and home affairs)">Joint action (Justice and home affairs)</A> <BR>•<A HREF="bword://Joint position (Title VI of the EU Treaty)">Joint position (Title VI of the EU Treaty)</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Pillars of the European Union">Pillars of the European Union</A> <BR>•<A HREF="bword://Police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters">Police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Schengen (Agreement and Convention)">Schengen (Agreement and Convention)</A><BR>•<A HREF="http://europa.eu.int/scadplus/leg/es/cig/g4000t.htm#t3">Title VI of the EU Treaty</A><BR><BR>
Kyoto Protocol	Adopted in December 1997, this Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change highlights the international community's new attitude towards the phenomenon of climate change. Under the Protocol, the industrialised countries have undertaken to reduce their emissions of six greenhouse gases (carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons and sulphur hexafluoride) by at least 5% during the period 2008-2012 compared with 1990 levels.<BR><BR>For their part, the Member States of the European Union have undertaken to reduce their emissions over the same period by 8%.<BR><BR>In 2000, global emissions of the six greenhouse gases in the countries of the Union were 3.5% below 1990 levels.<BR><BR>On 31 May 2002, the Union and its Member States ratified the Kyoto protocol. Nevertheless, the protocol is not yet in force.<BR><BR>See:<BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Environment">Environment</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Sustainable development">Sustainable development</A><BR><BR>
Laeken Declaration	One year after the Treaty of Nice and the Nice Declaration, which calls for institutional reform to be pursued beyond the 2000 Intergovernmental Conference (IGC 2000), the European Council, meeting in Laeken, adopted a Declaration on the Future of the European Union, or Laeken Declaration, on 15 December 2001, committing the Union to becoming more democratic, transparent and effective.<BR><BR>This Declaration poses 60 targeted questions on the future of the Union, around four main themes: the division and definition of powers, the simplification of the treaties, the institutional set-up and moving towards a Constitution for European citizens. It convened a Convention, gathering together the main stakeholders, in order to examine the fundamental questions raised by the future development of the Union so as to prepare in as broad and transparent a way as possible for the next IGC.<BR><BR>See: <BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Debate on the future of the European Union">Debate on the future of the European Union</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://European Convention">European Convention</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Intergovernmental Conference (IGC)">Intergovernmental Conference (IGC)</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Treaty of Nice">Treaty of Nice</A><BR><BR>
Legal personality of the Union	The question of the Union's legal status has arisen primarily in connection with its capacity to conclude treaties or accede to agreements or conventions, since the Union, which comprises three separate Communities, each with legal personality (European Community, ECSC and Euratom) and two areas of intergovernmental cooperation, does not have what is known in international law as "treaty-making powers", that is, the international right to conclude agreements with third countries.<BR><BR>The Treaty of Amsterdam contains no new provisions on the subject, as the Member States failed to reach agreement at the Intergovernmental Conference. Some observers argue that the problem is non-existent and there is nothing to prevent the Union from concluding agreements and asserting its position on the international scene.<BR><BR>See:<BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://European Convention on Human Rights">European Convention on Human Rights</A> <BR>•<A HREF="bword://Pilars of the European Union ">Pilars of the European Union </A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Single institutional framework">Single institutional framework</A> <BR><BR>
Luxembourg compromise	The Luxembourg compromise, reached in January 1966, brought to an end the so-called "empty chair" crisis, France having refused to take its seat in the Council since July 1965. The compromise was an acknowledgement of the disagreement existing between those who, when a major national interest was at stake, wanted the members of the Council to do their best within a reasonable space of time to find solutions which all sides could adopt without encroaching on their mutual interests, and France, which was in favour of keeping discussions going until unanimous agreement was reached. Subsequently other Member States were to side with the French point of view.<BR><BR>The compromise has not prevented the Council from taking decisions in accordance with the EC Treaty, which provides in many cases for voting by qualified majority. Nor has it hindered the members of the Council from making further efforts to bring points of view closer together before the Council takes a decision.<BR><BR>See:<BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Council of the European Union ">Council of the European Union </A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Qualified majority">Qualified majority</A> <BR>•<A HREF="bword://Unanimity">Unanimity</A><BR><BR>
Measures to combat money laundering	Money laundering consists in falsely justifying the origin of property or income accruing by way of a breach of criminal law or in assisting with such an operation. <BR><BR>Given the scale of the problem, combating money laundering is now a priority for the European Union. In the conclusions of the Tampere European Council on 15 and 16 October 1999, the Heads of State and Government expressed their desire to see money laundering "rooted out wherever it occurs". <BR><BR>A number of instruments have been adopted, the two most important being:<BR><BR>•the Directive of 10 June 1991 on prevention of the use of the financial system for the purpose of money laundering, as amended by Parliament and the Council on 4 December 2001;<BR>•the Convention on mutual assistance in criminal matters of 29 May 2000 and its Protocol, adopted by the Council on 16 October 2001.<BR><BR>See:<BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Area of freedom, security and justice">Area of freedom, security and justice</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Fight against international organised crime">Fight against international organised crime</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Justice and Home Affairs (JHA)">Justice and Home Affairs (JHA)</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters">Police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters</A><BR><BR>
Monetary policy	Monetary policy is covered by Articles 105 to 111 (former Articles 105 to 109) of the EC Treaty. It is fundamental to economic and monetary union (EMU). Decision-making procedures vary according to the topics in hand:<BR><BR>•for the issue of coins by the Member States (Art. 106(2)), the cooperation procedure applies, after consultation of the European Central Bank (ECB);<BR>•for the formulation of exchange-rate policy guidelines (Art. 111(2)), the Council decides by a qualified majority on a recommendation from the ECB or from the Commission after consulting the ECB;<BR>•for the implementing measures referred to in the Statute of the European System of Central Banks (ESCB) (Art. 107(6)) and the limits and conditions under which the ECB is entitled to impose fines (Art. 109(3)), the Council decides by a qualified majority on a recommendation from the ECB and after consulting the European Parliament and the Commission;<BR>•for technical adjustments to the Statute of the ESCB (Art. 107(5)), the Council decides by a qualified majority on a recommendation from the ECB and after consulting the Commission and obtaining the assent of the European Parliament;<BR>•for the exchange rate of the Euro against non-Community currencies (Art. 111(1)), the Council decides unanimously on a recommendation from the ECB or the Commission, after consulting the European Parliament.<BR><BR>The institutional provisions (Articles 112-115) and transitional provisions (Articles 116-124) of Title VII of the EC Treaty (economic and monetary policy - former Title VI) have their own special decision-making procedures which are separate from those identified here.<BR><BR>See:<BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Consultation procedure">Consultation procedure</A> <BR>•<A HREF="bword://Convergence criteria">Convergence criteria</A> <BR>•<A HREF="bword://Cooperation procedure ">Cooperation procedure </A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Council of the European Union ">Council of the European Union </A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Economic and monetary union">Economic and monetary union</A> <BR>•<A HREF="bword://European Central Bank">European Central Bank</A> <BR>•<A HREF="bword://European Commission">European Commission</A> <BR>•<A HREF="bword://European Parliament">European Parliament</A> <BR>•<A HREF="bword://Qualified majority">Qualified majority</A> <BR>•<A HREF="bword://Stability and Growth Pact">Stability and Growth Pact</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Unanimity">Unanimity</A><BR><BR>
Monitoring the application of Community law	The task of monitoring the application of Community law falls to the European Commission as the guardian of the Treaties. It is an expression of the fact that the European Union is based on the rule of law and its purpose is to make sure that the law is observed and actually applied in and by the Member States. In exercising its monitoring function the Commission takes care to safeguard the role which is also assigned to national authorities, particularly the courts, in this area.<BR><BR>Monitoring the application of the law may take the following forms:<BR><BR>•instituting infringement proceedings following complaints or where cases are discovered in the ordinary course of events;<BR>•court action against the other institutions;<BR>•checking whether aid given by the Member States is lawful;<BR>•checking that the principles prohibiting certain types of agreements, decisions and concerted practices and the abuse of a dominant position are observed.<BR><BR>The Commission's annual reports on the application of Community law are an expression of the desire for transparency in dealings not only with complainants but also with citizens and members of parliament.<BR><BR>See:<BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Citizenship of the Union">Citizenship of the Union</A> <BR>•<A HREF="bword://Court of Justice of the European Union">Court of Justice of the European Union</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://European Commission">European Commission</A> <BR>•<A HREF="bword://Transparency (access to documents)">Transparency (access to documents)</A><BR><BR>
NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organisation)|NATO|North Atlantic Treaty Organisation	The North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO, or the Atlantic Alliance) was founded in 1949 and has its headquarters in Brussels. It has 19 members: the EU Member States (with the exception of Austria, Finland, Ireland and Sweden), Canada, the United States, Iceland, Norway and Turkey, and ,since 12 March 1999, Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic.<BR><BR>The policy of the Union respects the obligations on certain Member States arising out of NATO membership and is compatible with the common security and defence policy agreed in NATO. The Declaration on Western European Union annexed to the EU Treaty clarifies future relations between NATO and the WEU, which serves as the defence arm of the Union and as a means of strengthening the European pillar of the Atlantic Alliance.<BR><BR>See:<BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Collective defence">Collective defence</A> <BR>•<A HREF="bword://Common foreign and security policy (CFSP)">Common foreign and security policy (CFSP)</A> <BR>•<A HREF="bword://European Security and Defence Policy (ESDP)">European Security and Defence Policy (ESDP)</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://'New look' NATO">'New look' NATO</A> <BR>•<A HREF="bword://Western European Union (WEU)">Western European Union (WEU)</A><BR><BR>
National parliaments	The Conference of European Community Affairs Committees (Cosac) has met every six months since 1989. It consists of representatives of the relevant committees in the national parliaments and of members of the European Parliament.<BR><BR>With the entry into force of the Maastricht Treaty, the European Union acquired competence in areas which had traditionally been a national preserve, such as justice and home affairs. For this reason, the importance of exchanges between national parliaments and the European Parliament was underlined in a declaration on the role of national parliaments in the European Union. The national governments were also asked to ensure that their parliaments received Commission proposals in good time for possible examination. Providing national parliaments with more information would enable them to be more closely involved in the Community process and to exercise closer democratic control over it.<BR><BR>Under the Treaty of Amsterdam a Protocol on the role of national parliaments has been annexed to the EU Treaty, specifying the information that must be sent to national parliaments (White Papers, Green Papers, communications and proposals for legislation). National parliaments have a period of six weeks to discuss a legislative proposal from the date when the Commission makes it available to the European Parliament and the Council up to the date when it is placed on the Council's agenda.<BR><BR>COSAC now also has the power to send the Union institutions any contribution which it deems appropriate and to examine any proposal for a legislative instrument relating to the establishment of the area of freedom, security and justice (which might have a bearing on the rights and freedoms of individuals).<BR><BR>As part of the applicant countries' preparation for accession to the European Union, representatives of the national parliaments of the six 'first-wave' countries (Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Poland and Slovenia) have been taking part in COSAC's work since accession negotiations began on 30 March 1988.<BR><BR>See:<BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://European Parliament">European Parliament</A><BR><BR>
Non-discrimination principle	The aim of this principle is to ensure equality of treatment for individuals irrespective of nationality, sex, racial or ethnic origin, religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation.<BR><BR>Article 12 of the EC Treaty (former Article 6) outlaws any discrimination on the grounds of nationality. Under the Treaty of Amsterdam a new Article 13 has been written into the EC Treaty to reinforce the guarantee of non-discrimination laid down in the Treaties and extend it to the other cases cited above.<BR><BR>See:<BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Equal opportunities">Equal opportunities</A> <BR>•<A HREF="bword://Equal treatment for men and women">Equal treatment for men and women</A> <BR>•<A HREF="bword://European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR)">European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR)</A><BR><BR>
OLAF (European Anti-fraud Office)|European Anti-fraud Office|OLAF	Since 1 June 1999, the European Anti-fraud Office has been responsible for combating fraud against the European Union budget. <BR><BR>The Office, which was set up under the European Commission Decision of 28 April 1999, replaces the Coordination of Fraud Prevention Unit (UCLAF) in the Commission, set up in 1998 and confined to that one institution. On 6 October 1998 when addressing the European Parliament, Jacques Santer proposed making this department an independent body with extended powers. <BR><BR>The new Office can look into the management and financing of all the Union's institutions and bodies with total operational independence guaranteed by:<BR><BR>•the Director of OLAF: appointed by agreement between Parliament, the Commission and the Council, he is entitled to bring cases before the Court of Justice in order to protect his independence. In addition, he can launch an investigation not only at the request of the institution, body or Member State in question but also on his own initiative.<BR>•OLAF's Supervisory Committee: it is responsible for monitoring investigations and it consists of five well-known independent external figures appointed jointly by Parliament, the Commission and the Council.<BR><BR>The rules governing internal inquiries conducted by OLAF in order to combat fraud, corruption and other unlawful activities carried out to the detriment of the European Communities' financial interests are set out in the Interinstitutional Agreement of 25 May 1999 between Parliament, the Council and the Commission. This Agreement extends the powers of the Office to serious actions which could amount to professional misconduct by officials and other staff and which could lead to disciplinary measures or criminal prosecutions. <BR><BR>See: <BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://European Commission">European Commission</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Fight against fraud">Fight against fraud</A><BR><BR>
Objectives 1, 2 and 3|Objective 1|Objective 2|Objective 3	The Agenda 2000 reform of the structural funds focuses assistance available under the Community's regional policy on crucial development problems. The present rules thus envisage the setting of three priority objectives, as compared with six previously.<BR><BR>Objective 1 promotes the catching-up of the economies of regions whose development is lagging behind. It is "regionalised" in that it applies to statistically demarcated regions. Only those whose per capita GDP is less than 75% of the Community average are eligible. The seven "outermost" regions, the areas in Sweden and Finland with very low population density and Northern Ireland also receive assistance. In all, Objective 1 covers sixty or so regions in thirteen Member States. Transitional support is also available over a seven-year period for the regions previously eligible between 1994 and 1999 and a performance reserve for the most virtuous regions has been set up. Objective 1 receives 70% of the structural funds' budget (i.e. 137 billion over seven years), which is broken down between the four funds (ERDF, ESF, EAGGF Guidance Section and FIFG). Basic infrastructures, the development of human resources, investment in research and innovation, and the information society are the four main priority areas.<BR><BR>Objective 2 contributes to the economic and social conversion of regions in structural difficulties. It too is regionalised: the demarcation of eligible areas depends both on national and European population ceilings (18% of the Union's population) and on specific socio-economic criteria. Four categories of eligible area are defined: areas undergoing economic change in industry and the service sector, declining rural areas, urban areas in difficulty and depressed areas dependent on fisheries. Since all their territory is eligible under Objective 1, Greece, Ireland and Portugal do not qualify for assistance under Objective 2. Transitional support is also available for the regions previously eligible under Objectives 2 and 5(b) during the period 1994-99. The Objective 2 budget amounts to 22.5 billion over seven years (11.5% of the total budget) and is financed by the ERDF and the ESF.<BR><BR>Objective 3 supports the adaptation and modernisation of educational, training and employment policies and systems. It serves as the reference framework for all measures taken on the basis of the new employment title in the Treaty of Amsterdam and for the resulting European strategy. It is not regionalised: all regions falling outside Objective 1 are eligible. It has a budget of 24.05 billion over seven years (12.3% of the total budget) and is financed exclusively by the ESF. <BR><BR>How Objectives 1, 2 and 3 develop beyond 2006 will depend on the forthcoming assessments of their impact on economic and social cohesion and on the outcome of the debate on the future of regional policy after 2006 and ahead of the Union's enlargement to take in the Central and Eastern European countries.<BR><BR>See:<BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Agenda 2000">Agenda 2000</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Economic and social cohesion">Economic and social cohesion</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Enlargement">Enlargement</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://European Employment Strategy (EES)">European Employment Strategy (EES)</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Structural Funds and Cohesion Fund">Structural Funds and Cohesion Fund</A><BR><BR>
Ombudsman	The European Ombudsman is appointed by the European Parliament after each election for the duration of Parliament's term of office. He is empowered to receive complaints from any citizen of the Union or any natural or legal person residing in a Member State concerning instances of maladministration in the activities of the Community institutions or bodies (with the exception of the Court of Justice and the Court of First Instance).<BR><BR>Where the Ombudsman establishes an instance of maladministration he refers the matter to the institution concerned, conducts an investigation, seeks a solution to redress the problem and, if necessary, submits draft recommendations to which the institution is required to reply in the form of a detailed report within three months.<BR><BR>He submits a report to the European Parliament at the end of each annual session.<BR><BR>See:<BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Citizenship of the Union">Citizenship of the Union</A> <BR>•<A HREF="bword://Court of Justice of the European Union">Court of Justice of the European Union</A> <BR>•<A HREF="bword://European Parliament">European Parliament</A> <BR><BR>
Opting out	Opting out is an exemption granted to a country that does not wish to join the other Member States in a particular area of Community cooperation as a way of avoiding a general stalemate. The United Kingdom, for instance, asked to be allowed not to take part in the third stage of economic and monetary union (EMU) and similar clauses were agreed with Denmark as regards EMU, defence and European citizenship.<BR><BR>See:<BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Closer cooperation">Closer cooperation</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://European Council">European Council</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Intergovernmental Conference (IGC)">Intergovernmental Conference (IGC)</A> <BR><BR>
Outermost regions	There are seven "outermost regions": Guadeloupe, French Guiana, Martinique, Réunion (the four French overseas departments referred to in Article 299(2) of the EC Treaty), the Azores, the Canaries and Madeira. They are the subject of a Declaration annexed to the Treaty.<BR><BR>The Declaration acknowledges that these regions suffer from major structural backwardness and states that, while the provisions of the EC Treaty and secondary legislation automatically apply, it is nonetheless possible to adopt specific measures to assist them as long as there is a real objective need for such measures to promote their economic and social development.<BR><BR>Article 299(2) has been amended by the Treaty of Amsterdam to enable the Council, acting by a qualified majority, to adopt specific decisions laying down conditions for applying the Treaty, including the common policies, to the outermost regions. In so doing, the Council has to ensure that the integrity and coherence of the Community legal order is not undermined.<BR><BR>See:<BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Economic and social cohesion">Economic and social cohesion</A><BR><BR>
Own resources	Originally, the Community budget, like that of other international organisations, depended on the Member States' financial contributions. However, under a decision adopted on 21 April 1970, the Member States' contributions were replaced by own resources. These are transfers paid by the Member States to the Community budget to cover the financing of expenditure by the European Union. The combined total of all own resources may not exceed 1.27% of the aggregate gross national product (GNP) of the Member States.<BR><BR>With the introduction of this system, financial autonomy was established, and since 1 January 1978, the Community budget has been entirely financed by own resources. These are currently made up of four elements:<BR><BR>•agricultural duties and the sugar and isoglucose levies: these consist mainly of the agricultural duties and, under the common organisation of the sugar markets, production and storage levies;<BR>•customs duties: these come from the application of the common customs tariff to imports from third countries;<BR>•the VAT resource: this comes from the application of a flat rate to the VAT base of each Member State. The rate was set at 1% for 1999, but, under the new own resources decision (September 2000), it will fall to 0.75% in 2002 and 2003 and to 0.50% from 2004. It is collected on a base which may not exceed 50% of a Member State's GNP;<BR>•the 'fourth resource': introduced in 1988, this is a so-called additional resource, because it is set according to the other three sources of budget revenue. It is based on GNP and the application of a rate, set under the budget procedure, to the total GNP of all the Member States.<BR><BR>In the 2002 budget, the revenue of the European Union amounted to EUR 95.6 billion, of which 43% came from the GNP resource, 38.3% from the VAT resource, 14.8% from customs duties and 1.8% from agricultural duties. <BR><BR>See:<BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Budget">Budget</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Customs Union">Customs Union</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Financial perspective 2000-2006">Financial perspective 2000-2006</A><BR><BR>
Parliamentary committees	Various committees have been set up within the European Parliament to organise its work. The members of each committee are elected at the beginning of and half-way through each parliamentary term, according to their political affiliation and their expertise.<BR><BR>Parliament's Rules of Procedure specify that the Members of Parliament set the number of committees and determine their powers. At present there are seventeen specialised permanent committees in which the Commission's proposals are discussed. Parliament can also set up sub-committees, temporary committees and committees of inquiry if it considers it necessary. Two committees of inquiry have been set up so far: on the Community transit procedure in 1996 and on the bovine spongiform encepalopathy (BSE) epidemic in 1997.<BR><BR>The main task of the permanent committees is to debate proposals for new legislation put forward by the European Commission and to draw up own-initiative reports. For any proposal for legislation or other initiative, a rapporteur is nominated according to an agreement between the political groups which make up Parliament. His or her report is discussed, amended and voted on within the parliamentary committee and then transmitted to the plenary assembly, which meets once a month in Strasbourg, and which debates and votes on the basis of this report. <BR><BR>As preparation for Parliament's vote of approval of the European Commission, the parliamentary committees also hear the proposed Members of the Commission in their specialised areas. <BR><BR>See:<BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://European Commission">European Commission</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://European Parliament">European Parliament</A><BR><BR>
Petersberg tasks	These tasks were established in June 1992 at the Ministerial Council of the Western European Union (WEU) held at the Petersberg Hotel, not far from Bonn. On this occasion, the WEU Member States declared their readiness to make available military units from the whole spectrum of their conventional armed forces for military tasks conducted under the authority of the WEU. The different types of military tasks which the WEU can undertake were defined: apart from contributing to the collective defence in accordance with Article 5 of the Washington Treaty and Article V of the modified Brussels Treaty, military units of WEU Member States may be employed for:<BR><BR>•humanitarian and rescue tasks; <BR>•peace-keeping tasks; <BR>•tasks of combat forces in crisis management, including peacemaking. <BR><BR>These tasks are today expressly included in Article 17 of the Treaty on European Union and form an integral part of the European Security and Defence Policy (ESPD).<BR><BR>See:<BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Collective defence">Collective defence</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organisation)">NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organisation)</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://'New look' NATO">'New look' NATO</A> <BR>•<A HREF="bword://Western European Union (WEU)">Western European Union (WEU)</A> <BR><BR>
Petitions	The right of petition is the right which every citizen of the European Union enjoys, individually or in association with other citizens, to submit a request to the European Parliament or to table a grievance before it on any subject which falls within the spheres of activity of the Community and concerns him or her directly (Articles 21 and 194 of the EC Treaty, formerly Articles 8d and 138d).<BR><BR>Parliament's Committee on Petitions considers whether such requests are admissible. Where it sees fit, it may put a question to the Ombudsman. When drawing up an opinion on a petition deemed to be admissible, it may ask the European Commission to provide it with documents or information.<BR><BR>The Treaty of Amsterdam added a new paragraph to Article 21, stating that every citizen of the Union may write to any of the institutions, including the Committee of the Regions and the Economic and Social Committee, and to the Ombudsman in any of the official Union languages (including Irish) and receive an answer written in the same language.<BR><BR>See:<BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Citizenship of the Union">Citizenship of the Union</A> <BR>•<A HREF="bword://Ombudsman">Ombudsman</A><BR><BR>
Pillars of the European Union	In Community parlance people often refer to the three pillars of the EU Treaty. These are:<BR><BR>•the Community dimension, comprising the arrangements set out in the EC, ECSC and Euratom Treaties, i.e. Union citizenship, Community policies, Economic and Monetary Union, etc. (first pillar);<BR>•the common foreign and security policy, which comes under Title V of the EU Treaty (second pillar);<BR>•police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters, which comes under Title VI of the EU Treaty (third pillar).<BR><BR>The Treaty of Amsterdam has transferred some of the fields covered by the old third pillar to the first pillar (free movement of persons).<BR><BR>See:<BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Communitisation">Communitisation</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Single institutional framework">Single institutional framework</A> <BR><BR>
Planning and Early Warning Unit	The idea of setting up a Planning and Early Warning Unit under the common foreign and security policy stems from the belief that if the CFSP is to be effective, it will require earlier and more far-reaching analysis of external developments in the long, medium and short term. The decisions taken under the CFSP must therefore be underpinned by more reliable briefings, which are available to all the Member States of the Union.<BR><BR>In a declaration to the Final Act, the Intergovernmental Conference agreed to set up a Planning and Early Warning Unit in the General Secretariat of the Council, placed under the responsibility of its Secretary-General.

Police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters	Some of the policy areas previously covered by Title VI of the Treaty on European Union (Justice and Home Affairs or the "third pillar") were transferred to the first pillar by the Treaty of Amsterdam. For those remaining in the third pillar, especially police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters, the Treaty of Amsterdam establishes one of the Union's most important objectives: the creation of an area of freedom, security and justice.<BR><BR>The aim is to provide the public with a high level of protection by preventing and combating the phenomena of racism and xenophobia and other cross-border crime, including:<BR><BR>•terrorism; <BR>•trafficking in human beings and crimes against children; <BR>•drug trafficking; <BR>•arms trafficking; <BR>•corruption and fraud. <BR><BR>This is to be achieved by:<BR><BR>•closer cooperation between police forces and customs authorities through the European Police Office (Europol);<BR>•closer cooperation between the judicial authorities, including cooperation through the European Judicial Cooperation Unit (Eurojust), established by the Treaty of Nice;<BR>•approximation, where necessary, of rules on criminal matters in the Member States.<BR><BR>Although the Treaties of Amsterdam and Nice extended the use of qualified majority voting, however, decisions on matters covered by the third pillar still have to be adopted unanimously. On the area of freedom, security and justice on the other hand, a number of legal instruments used in the field of police and judicial cooperation since the Maastricht Treaty have changed. The common position and the convention remain, but joint actions have been replaced by two new instruments: decisions and framework decisions.<BR><BR>The Schengen <I>acquis</I> developed by some of the Member States in an intergovernmental framework, which also covers police and judicial cooperation, was also incorporated into the European Union and Community framework with the entry into force of the Amsterdam Treaty.<BR><BR>See:<BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Area of freedom, security and justice">Area of freedom, security and justice</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Convention (Title VI of the EU Treaty)">Convention (Title VI of the EU Treaty)</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Decision and framework decision (Title VI of the EU Treaty)">Decision and framework decision (Title VI of the EU Treaty)</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://European arrest warrant">European arrest warrant</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://European Judicial Network in criminal matters (EJN)">European Judicial Network in criminal matters (EJN)</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Europol (European Police Office)">Europol (European Police Office)</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Fight against drugs">Fight against drugs</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Fight against fraud">Fight against fraud</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Fight against international organised crime">Fight against international organised crime</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Fight against racism and xenophobia">Fight against racism and xenophobia</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Fight against terrorism">Fight against terrorism</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Joint action (Justice and home affairs)">Joint action (Justice and home affairs)</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Joint position (Title VI of the EU Treaty)">Joint position (Title VI of the EU Treaty)</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Justice and home affairs (JHA)">Justice and home affairs (JHA)</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Measures to combat money laundering">Measures to combat money laundering</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Pillars of the European Union">Pillars of the European Union</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Schengen (Agreement and Convention)">Schengen (Agreement and Convention)</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Title VI of the EU Treaty">Title VI of the EU Treaty</A><BR><BR>

Political agenda of the European Union	The Madrid European Council (15-16 December 1995) described the European Union's agenda for the end of the century as laying the foundations for the Europe of the future, a large community enjoying the benefits of freedom, prosperity and stability. In practical terms this means:<BR><BR>•adjusting the Treaty on European Union;<BR>•making the transition to a single currency in line with the agreed timetable and conditions;<BR>•preparing for and carrying out the enlargement negotiations;<BR>•adopting the financial perspective for the period beyond 31 December 1999;<BR>•contributing to establishing the new European security architecture;<BR>•actively continuing the policy of dialogue, cooperation and association already under way with the Union's neighbouring countries, and in particular with Russia, Ukraine, Turkey and the Mediterranean countries.<BR><BR>See:<BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Common foreign and security policy (CFSP)">Common foreign and security policy (CFSP)</A> <BR>•<A HREF="bword://Economic and monetary union">Economic and monetary union</A> <BR>•<A HREF="bword://Enlargement">Enlargement</A> <BR>•<A HREF="bword://European Council">European Council</A> <BR><BR>
Pre-accession aid	Enormous investment is required if the applicant countries are to adapt their standards, especially their industrial and environmental norms, in order to be able to comply with Community legislation when they join the Union. The pre-accession aid for the period 2000-2006 for the countries of Central and Eastern Europe is a key element of the European Union's strategy towards the applicants and involves two main components:<BR><BR>•the Phare programme finances the projects needed to adapt the applicant countries' administrative and legal systems and to develop their infrastructure (EUR 10.5 billion); <BR>•two assistance funds have been set up to manage additional aid:<BR>-the first supports structural measures in the field of agriculture (SAPARD - EUR 3.5 billion)<BR>-the second finances infrastructure development in the fields of the environment and transport (Instrument for Structural Policies for Pre-Accession, ISPA - EUR 7 billion). ISPA plays the same role for the applicant countries as the Cohesion Fund does for Spain, Portugal, Greece and Ireland. <BR><BR>The accession partnership concluded between the Union and the applicant countries constitutes the main thrust of the pre-accession strategy and serves as the channel for the various types of aid.<BR><BR>Cyprus, Malta and Turkey receive specific pre-accession aid. Council Regulation (EC) No 555/2000 provides for a reference amount of EUR 95 million for the implementation of operations in the framework of the pre-accession strategy for Cyprus and Malta (EUR 57 million for Cyprus and EUR 38 million for Malta). This amount is available until 31 December 2004. Regulation (EC) No 2500/2001 concerning pre-accession financial assistance for Turkey provides for specific aid totalling over EUR 2 million.<BR><BR>All of the applicant countries may also participate in the pre-accession instrument of the European Investment Bank (EIB).<BR><BR>Additional pre-accession aid for Bulgaria and Romania was approved at the Copenhagen European Council (12 and 13 December 2002).<BR><BR>See:<BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Accession negotiations">Accession negotiations</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Accession partnership">Accession partnership</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Applicant countries">Applicant countries</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Community acquis">Community acquis</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Enlargement">Enlargement</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://European Investment Bank (EIB)">European Investment Bank (EIB)</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Incorporation of the Community acquis">Incorporation of the Community acquis</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Pre-accession strategy">Pre-accession strategy</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Programme of Community aid to the countries of Central and Eastern Europe (Phare)">Programme of Community aid to the countries of Central and Eastern Europe (Phare)</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Screening">Screening</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Structural Funds and Cohesion Fund">Structural Funds and Cohesion Fund</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://TAIEX (Technical Assistance Information Exchange Office)">TAIEX (Technical Assistance Information Exchange Office)</A><BR><BR>
Pre-accession pact on organised crime	In preparation for the enlargement of the European Union, on 28 May 1998 the ministers of justice and home affairs of the Member States and the ten Central and Eastern European candidate countries and Cyprus adopted a 'pre-accession pact on organised crime' with the aim of:<BR><BR>•associating the applicant countries with the European Union's priority actions; <BR>•helping the candidate countries to adopt the <I>acquis communautaire</I> in justice and home affairs; <BR>•setting up joint projects against crime for which technical or financial assistance from the Union would be helpful. <BR><BR>The candidate countries undertook to rapidly adopt a number of international conventions, particularly those regarding extradition (1957 European Convention), drug trafficking (UN Convention) and terrorism (1977 European Convention). Agreements with Europol are planned, in order to promote the exchange of information and to define priorities for the action to be taken by the Union and its partners.<BR><BR>The pre-accession pact is funded by the Phare Programme and other programmes including Grotius, Stop and Falcone.<BR><BR>It is now an essential tool for the gradual integration of the candidate countries into the Community strategy for the monitoring and prevention of organised crime.<BR><BR>See:<BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Accession partnership">Accession partnership</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Applicant countries">Applicant countries</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Community acquis ">Community acquis </A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Enlargement">Enlargement</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Europol (European Police Office)">Europol (European Police Office)</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Fight against international organised crime">Fight against international organised crime</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Incorporation of the Community acquis">Incorporation of the Community acquis</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Justice and home affairs (JHA)">Justice and home affairs (JHA)</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Pre-accession strategy">Pre-accession strategy</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Programme of Community aid to the countries of Central and Eastern Europe (Phare)">Programme of Community aid to the countries of Central and Eastern Europe (Phare)</A><BR><BR>
Pre-accession strategy	On the basis of the Europe Agreements (association agreements with Central and Eastern European countries), in 1993 the Commission proposed that there be a 'structured dialogue' between the associated countries and the institutions of the Union in the form of meetings at which the different partners could consult each other.<BR><BR>In December 1994 the Essen European Council adopted a pre-accession strategy based on:<BR><BR>•deepening relations between the associated countries, the Member States and the institutions of the Union (strengthening the structured dialogue); <BR>•implementation of the Europe Agreements; <BR>•adaptation of the financial assistance provided by Phare.<BR><BR>At December 1997's Luxembourg European Council a reinforced pre-accession strategy was launched for the ten Central and Eastern European applicant countries. It is based on:<BR><BR>•the Europe Agreements; <BR>•the accession partnerships and the national programmes for the adoption of the <I>acquis</I>;<BR>•participation in certain Community programmes, agencies and committees.<BR><BR>For Cyprus, a special pre-accession strategy was put in place the same year. In 1998 a strategy was adopted for Malta, and the last strategy is now taking shape for Turkey. Pre-accession strategies for Malta and Turkey are based on:<BR><BR>•the association agreements; <BR>•the accession partnerships and the national programmes for the adoption of the <I>acquis</I>;<BR>•participation in Community programmes, agencies and committees;<BR>•special pre-accession aid;<BR>•in Turkey's case, a reinforced political dialogue.<BR><BR>The Copenhagen European Council of 12 and 13 December 2002 substantially increased pre-accession aid for Bulgaria and Romania.<BR><BR>See:<BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Accession negotiations">Accession negotiations</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Accession partnership">Accession partnership</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Agenda 2000">Agenda 2000</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Applicant countries">Applicant countries</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Community acquis">Community acquis</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Enlargement">Enlargement</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Europe Agreement">Europe Agreement</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Financial perspective 2000-2006">Financial perspective 2000-2006</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Incorporation of the Community acquis">Incorporation of the Community acquis</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Pre-accession aid">Pre-accession aid</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Programme of Community aid to the countries of Central and Eastern Europe (Phare)">Programme of Community aid to the countries of Central and Eastern Europe (Phare)</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Screening">Screening</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://TAIEX (Technical Assistance Information Exchange Office)">TAIEX (Technical Assistance Information Exchange Office)</A><BR><BR>
Precautionary Principle	On 2 February 2000, the European Commission adopted a communication on the precautionary principle, in which it defined this concept and explained how it intended to apply it. <BR><BR>This text complements the White Paper on Food Safety (January 2000) and the agreement concluded in February 2000 in Montreal on the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety.<BR><BR>In this document, the Commission sets out the specific cases where this principle is applicable:<BR><BR>•where the scientific data are insufficient, inconclusive or uncertain;<BR>•where a preliminary scientific evaluation shows that potentially dangerous effects for the environment and human, animal or plant health can reasonably be feared.<BR><BR>In both cases, the risks are incompatible with the high level of protection sought by the European Union.<BR><BR>The Communication also sets out the three rules which must be followed for the precautionary principle to be respected:<BR><BR>•a complete scientific evaluation carried out by an independent authority in order to determine the degree of scientific uncertainty;<BR>•an assessment of the potential risks and the consequences of inaction;<BR>•the participation, under conditions of maximum transparency, of all the interested parties in the study of possible measures.<BR><BR>Finally, the Commission would like to point out that the measures resulting from recourse to the precautionary principle may take the form of a decision to act or not to act, depending on the level of risk considered "acceptable". The Union applied the precautionary principle in the area of GMOs, for instance, with the entry into force of a moratorium in 1999.<BR><BR>See:<BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Consumer protection">Consumer protection</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Environment">Environment</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Food safety">Food safety</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Genetically modified organisms (GMOs)">Genetically modified organisms (GMOs)</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Public health">Public health</A><BR><BR>
Presidency of the Union (rotation of the Presidency)|Presidency of the Union|rotation of the Presidency	The Presidency of the Union is held in turn on a six-monthly basis by each Member State. A stint in the Presidency is a duty and a contribution that each Member State makes to the proper functioning of the Community institutions. At present, a Member State holds the Presidency every seven and a half years<BR><BR>In the context of the institutional aspect of the accession negotiations, it has been established that the order of rotation between the 15 current Member States will be maintained until 2006, in order to give new members a minimum period in which to adapt and prepare for taking on the Presidency of the Council themselves.<BR><BR>In any event, in the run-up to enlargement this system of rotation is demonstrating its limits, and the 2004 Intergovernmental Conference is to propose an alternative: a revolving but more stable presidential team, a long-term "President of Europe" or various formulae depending on the different formations (Summit, Council of Ministers, Coreper); there are a number of proposals.<BR><BR>See: <BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Coreper">Coreper</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Council of the European Union">Council of the European Union</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://European Council">European Council</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Troïka">Troïka</A><BR><BR>
President of the European Commission	The Treaty of Amsterdam strengthened the role and position of the President of the European Commission. The governments of the Member States currently designate the person they intend to appoint as President by common accord - a choice which then has to be approved by the European Parliament.<BR><BR>The governments then designate the persons they intend to appoint as Members of the Commission, in agreement with the new President. The President lays down the broad policy lines to be followed by the Commission in its work. He also decides on the allocation of portfolios among the Commissioners and any reshuffling of portfolios during the Commission's term of office.<BR><BR>The Treaty of Nice, which entered into force on 1 February 2003, has altered the procedure for appointing the President. From now on, the European Council meeting at the level of the heads of state and government will designate the person that they intend to appoint by a qualified majority. The European Parliament then approves this appointment.<BR><BR>The new Article 217 of the EC Treaty also extends the President's powers as an essential means of ensuring the continued coherence and effectiveness of an enlarged body of Commissioners. This means that the President will decide on the Commission's internal organisation, the allocation of portfolios and any reshuffling of portfolios during the Commission's term of office. He will also, subject to the collective approval of the Commission, appoint Vice-Presidents, the number of which is not specified in the Treaty. He may further, again subject to the approval of the College, require a Member of the Commission to resign.<BR><BR>The European Convention, brought into being by the Laeken Declaration in December 2001, is looking at the issues of institutional reform and the future of the Commission President: should the method of appointing the President be changed again? (a greater say for the Parliament, direct election), should his role be replaced by a "President of Europe" attached to the Council and/or the Commission and selected from among the heads of state?<BR><BR>See:<BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Composition of the European Commission">Composition of the European Commission</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Confirmation of the European Commission">Confirmation of the European Commission</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://European Commission">European Commission</A><BR><BR>
Programme of Community aid to the countries of Central and Eastern Europe (Phare)|Phare|Programme of Community aid to the countries of Central and Eastern Europe	The Phare programme was launched in 1989 following the collapse of the communist regimes in Central and Eastern Europe. It was intended to help these countries rebuild their economies. Originally, it concerned only Poland and Hungary but it has gradually been extended to cover ten Central and Eastern European countries today (Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia).<BR><BR>At the same time, Phare is the main financial instrument for the pre-accession strategy for the ten Central and Eastern European Countries (CEECs) which have applied for membership of the European Union. Since 1994, Phare's tasks have been adapted to the priorities and needs of each CEEC.<BR><BR>The revamped Phare programme with a budget of over EUR 10 billion for the period 2000-2006 now has two specific priorities, namely:<BR><BR>•institution building;<BR>•investment financing. <BR><BR>Following the proposals put forward by the Commission in its Agenda 2000 communication in July 1997, new forms of pre-accession aid have been added to that already provided by Phare. These are:<BR><BR>•structural measures to bring the level of environmental protection and of transport infrastructure development in the applicant countries closer to that of the European Union (Ispa);<BR>•aid to agriculture (Sapard). Phare's budget for 2002 was EUR 1.664 billion.<BR><BR>See:<BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Agenda 2000">Agenda 2000</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Applicant countries">Applicant countries</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Enlargement">Enlargement</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Pre-accession aid">Pre-accession aid</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Pre-accession strategy">Pre-accession strategy</A><BR><BR>
Public health	Public health is covered by Article 152 of the EC Treaty (former Article 129), which was introduced by the Treaty of Maastricht. This article states that Community action is to focus on the prevention of illnesses, including drug addiction, by promoting research into their causes and their transmission, as well as health information and education. The Treaty of Amsterdam reinforces these objectives by requiring that the definition and implementation of all Community policies and activities ensures a high level of human health protection.<BR><BR>Under Article 152 action towards these ends may involve Community measures, complementing action by the Member States. But the main approach should be to encourage cooperation between the Member States, in line with the subsidiarity principle.<BR><BR>The institutional arrangements are that the Council adopts incentive actions on the basis of the codecision procedure, while recommendations are adopted by qualified majority on a Commission proposal. The Treaty of Amsterdam extends the scope of actions covered by the codecision procedure to include measures setting high standards of quality and safety of organs and substances of human origin, as well as measures in the veterinary and phytosanitary fields.<BR><BR>See:<BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Codecision procedure">Codecision procedure</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Food safety">Food safety</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Precautionary Principle">Precautionary Principle</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Subsidiarity">Subsidiarity</A><BR><BR>
Public service	The concept of public service is a twofold one: it embraces both bodies providing services and the general-interest services they provide. Public-service obligations may be imposed by the public authorities on the body providing a service (airlines, road or rail carriers, energy producers and so on), either nationally or regionally. Incidentally, the concept of the public service and the concept of the public sector (including the civil service) are often, wrongly, confused; they differ in terms of function, status, ownership and "clientele".<BR><BR>See:<BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://General-interest services">General-interest services</A> <BR>•<A HREF="">Public service Charter</A> <BR>•<A HREF="bword://Services of general economic interest">Services of general economic interest</A> <BR>•<A HREF="bword://Subsidiarity">Subsidiarity</A> <BR>•<A HREF="bword://Universal service">Universal service</A><BR><BR>
Public service charter	The idea behind a public service charter is that there should be an instrument setting out the basic rights and principles governing the provision of services to users. Such principles would include:<BR><BR>•continuity of service;<BR>•quality;<BR>•security of supply;<BR>•equal access;<BR>•affordable prices;<BR>•social, cultural and environmental acceptability.<BR><BR>See:<BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Public service">Public service</A> <BR>•<A HREF="bword://Universal service">Universal service</A><BR><BR>
Qualified majority	A qualified majority is the number of votes required in the Council for a decision to be adopted when issues are being debated on the basis of Article 205(2) of the EC Treaty (former Article 148(2)). Until 1 November 2004, the date of the entry into force of the provisions in the Nice Treaty on Council decision-making, the threshold for the qualified majority is set at 62 votes out of 87 (71%), and Member States' votes are weighted on the basis of their population and corrected in favour of less-populated countries as follows: France, Germany, Italy and United Kingdom 10 votes each; Spain 8 votes; Belgium, Greece, the Netherlands and Portugal 5 votes each; Austria and Sweden 4 votes each; Denmark, Ireland and Finland 3 votes each; Luxembourg 2 votes.<BR><BR>Following the 2000 IGC and the Nice Treaty, the number of votes allocated to each Member State has been reweighted, in particular for those States with larger populations, so that the legitimacy of the Council's decisions can be safeguarded in terms of their demographic representativeness.<BR><BR>The Nice Treaty also amended the qualified majority decision-making system. A qualified majority is deemed to have been reached when two conditions are fulfilled: the decision receives a set number of votes (which will change as new countries join) and is agreed by a majority of Member States. Moreover, a Member State may request that it be verified that the qualified majority represents at least 62% of the total population of the Union. If this is not the case, the decision is not adopted.<BR><BR>As the various institutional reforms have taken effect, qualified majority voting has replaced unanimous voting, which is less effective for developing an operational Community policy (veto risk).<BR><BR>The results of the last IGC are in line with this, as 27 new provisions are passing in whole or in part from unanimity to a qualified majority, including areas such as judicial cooperation in civil matters, commercial contracts on services or intellectual property, cohesion policy (from 2007 onwards), industrial policy, measures to facilitate the free movement of citizens, economic, financial and technical cooperation with third countries, and the appointment of members of certain institutions. The move to qualified majority voting was not accepted for social and tax policy.<BR><BR>Moreover, most of the legislative measures that, under the Nice Treaty, require a qualified majority will be decided by the codecision procedure. However, the IGC did not extend the codecision procedure to legislative measures that already today come under the qualified majority system (such as agriculture or commercial policy). The link between a qualified majority and the codecision procedure does therefore not necessarily exist for all legislative decisions.<BR><BR>See:<BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Codecision procedure">Codecision procedure</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Council of the European Union">Council of the European Union</A> <BR>•<A HREF="bword://Double majority">Double majority</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Intergovernmental Conference (IGC)">Intergovernmental Conference (IGC)</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Ioannina compromise">Ioannina compromise</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Reinforced qualified majority">Reinforced qualified majority</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Treaty of Nice">Treaty of Nice</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Unanimity ">Unanimity </A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Weighting of votes in the Council">Weighting of votes in the Council</A>
Recasting of legislation	The recasting of legislation means the adoption, when an amendment is made to a basic instrument, of a new legal instrument which incorporates the said amendment into the basic instrument, but repeals and replaces the latter. Unlike formal consolidation, it involves changes of substance. It also gives a comprehensive overview of an area of legislation. The new legal instrument is published in the Official Journal (L series).<BR><BR>See:<BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Consolidation of legislation: formal/official">Consolidation of legislation: formal/official</A> <BR>•<A HREF="bword://Simplification of legislation">Simplification of legislation</A> <BR><BR>
Reinforced qualified majority	At the 1996 Intergovernemental Conference, which led to the adoption of the Amsterdam Treaty, the idea of a reinforced qualified majority was raised both by a large number of national delegations and by the European Commission. This proposal stems from the conviction that if the unanimity requirement is maintained in an enlarged Union it will all too often result in stalemate. Unanimity might therefore be replaced in certain cases by a reinforced qualified majority which is higher than the normal percentage of votes generally required for majority voting. <BR><BR>In December 2001, in the context of the European Convention set up by the Laeken Declaration, it was suggested that the reinforced qualified majority could be used for adopting the section of the future EU constitutional treaty comprising the basic principles. This option would make it possible to find an intermediate arrangement between unanimity (source of stalemate) and a qualified majority, which is insufficient in terms of representativeness for the adoption of basic texts.<BR><BR>See:<BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Double majority">Double majority</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://European Convention">European Convention</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Hierarchy of Community acts (hierarchy of norms)">Hierarchy of Community acts (hierarchy of norms)</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Intergovernmental Conference (IGC)">Intergovernmental Conference (IGC)</A> <BR>•<A HREF="bword://Qualified majority">Qualified majority</A> <BR>•<A HREF="bword://Unanimity">Unanimity</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Weighting of votes in the Council">Weighting of votes in the Council</A><BR><BR>
Research and development	European research and development policy is based on provisions in the three founding treaties (ECSC, Euratom and Title XVIII of the EC Treaty). The Single European Act introduced the concept of technology into Community law and the EU Treaty then developed the Community's objectives in this field. Supporting the competitiveness of European industry and promoting research to help it face technological challenges are the Community's priorities.<BR><BR>The coordination of initiatives in research and development within the Community is based on various instruments:<BR><BR>•the framework programme for research and technological development. This multi-annual programme, set up in 1984, coordinates more specific programmes dedicated to fields as varied as information and communication technologies, the environment, biology, energy (including nuclear), transport and mobility of researchers. The fifth framework programme (1998-2002) has been allocated more than EUR 14.9 billion to achieve its objectives, including promotion of a user-friendly information society and access to research for small businesses;<BR>•the Joint Research Centre (JRC) and the Euratom Supply Agency. The JRC is made up of eight research institutes set up across the European Community to meet the specific needs of the Commission. It is at the forefront of research in nuclear energy (especially security) and has diversified into sectors such as materials, the environment, and industrial risks.<BR>•COST, which was set up in 1971, covers 25 countries: the fifteen Member States of the European Union plus Iceland, Norway, Switzerland, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Slovakia, Slovenia and Turkey. The aim of this European cooperation programme is to coordinate national research priorities in Europe;<BR>•Eureka is an intergovernmental organisation of 26 countries including the Member States of the European Union, Russia, Switzerland and Turkey. It was set up in 1985 and aims to support partnerships between businesses and research institutes, especially in advanced technology sectors.<BR><BR>The multiannual framework programme is adopted under the codecision procedure. Unanimity in the Council is no longer required following the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam. The specific programmes are always adopted by the Council by a qualified majority on a Commission proposal, after consulting the European Parliament and the Economic and Social Committee.<BR><BR>See:<BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://European Research Area (ERA)">European Research Area (ERA)</A><BR><BR>
Revision of the Treaties	Article 48 (former Article N) of the EU Treaty is the legal base which enables a conference of representatives of the Member States' governments (an IGC) to be convened for the purpose of amending the Treaties. It stipulates that any Member State, or the Commission, may submit to the Council proposals for such amendments. If the Council, after consulting Parliament and the Commission, delivers an opinion in favour of calling a conference, it is convened by the President of the Council. Any subsequent amendments enter into force two months after being ratified by all the Member States in accordance with their respective constitutional requirements.<BR><BR>See:<BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Intergovernmental Conference (IGC)">Intergovernmental Conference (IGC)</A><BR><BR>
Right of initiative	So that it can play its role as guardian of the Treaties and defender of the general interest the Commission has been given a right of initiative which empowers and requires it to make proposals on the matters contained in the Treaty, either because the Treaty expressly so provides or because the Commission considers it necessary.<BR><BR>•This power of initiative is exclusive in respect of Community matters, the principle being that the Council takes decisions only "on a proposal from the Commission", so that there is a coherent framework for all initiatives.<BR>•Under the common foreign and security policy the Commission may make proposals, as may the Member States. On the other hand it has no such right in certain matters relating to justice and home affairs.<BR><BR>The Council and the European Parliament may also ask the Commission to put forward a proposal if they consider it necessary.<BR><BR>The right of initiative is regarded as a basic element in the institutional balance of the Community.<BR><BR>The Treaty of Amsterdam has extended the Commission's right of initiative to the new policies (health and employment), to matters relating to the free movement of persons, and to the third pillar. In the case of the third pillar, the Commission shares the right of initiative with the Member States.<BR><BR>See:<BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Area of freedom, security and justice">Area of freedom, security and justice</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Common foreign and security policy (CFSP)">Common foreign and security policy (CFSP)</A> <BR>•<A HREF="bword://European Commission">European Commission</A> <BR>•<A HREF="bword://Justice and home affairs (JHA)">Justice and home affairs (JHA)</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Pillars of the European Union">Pillars of the European Union</A> <BR>•<A HREF="bword://Single institutional framework">Single institutional framework</A> <BR><BR>
Rural development	Rural development is closely linked to the common agricultural policy (CAP) together with measures to support employment. But, traditionally uncoordinated, rural development measures and legal instruments have invariably suffered from the absence of linkage between them.<BR><BR>In order to make it fully coherent, Agenda 2000 set in motion the reform of the CAP. Discarding the goal of productivity to concentrate fully on quality and safety, the reform has made it possible to step up rural development measures, bringing them together in a single regulatory framework. As a result, rural development is now the second pillar of the CAP.<BR><BR>The financial framework for Agenda 2000, established in Berlin in 1999, allocated some EUR 45 billion each year to this second pillar for rural development measures in the period 2000-06, to be met from the EAGGF Guarantee or Guidance Section, depending on the regional context.<BR><BR>The instrument puts in place an integrated policy of sustainable rural development ensuring closer links between rural development and the common agricultural policy's prices and markets policy. In addition, it enables local players in a given rural area to come together around a local and integrated development strategy.<BR><BR>The goals pursued by rural development include:<BR><BR>•modernising farms;<BR>•producing safe, quality products;<BR>•ensuring fair and stable incomes for farmers;<BR>•meeting environmental challenges;<BR>•fostering supplementary or alternative job-creating activities, in a bid to halt the drift from the country and to strengthen the economic and social fabric of rural areas;<BR>•improving living and working conditions and equal opportunities.<BR><BR>The rural development measures designed to meet these goals have been divided into two categories:<BR><BR>•flanking measures in the 1992 CAP reform: early retirement, agro-environmental measures, afforestation and the scheme for less-favoured areas;<BR>•measures to modernise and diversify farms: investment in farms, start-up schemes for young farmers, training, support for investments in processing and marketing plants, supplementary aid for forestry, promoting and restructuring agriculture.<BR><BR>See:<BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Agenda 2000">Agenda 2000</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Common agricultural policy (CAP)">Common agricultural policy (CAP)</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Economic and social cohesion">Economic and social cohesion</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Food safety">Food safety</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Objectives 1,2 and 3">Objectives 1,2 and 3</A><BR><BR>
Schengen (Agreement and Convention)|Agreement and Convention|Schengen	By the Agreement signed at Schengen on 14 June 1985, Belgium, France, Germany, Luxembourg and the Netherlands agreed that they would gradually remove their common frontier controls and introduce freedom of movement for all individuals who were nationals of the signatory Member States, other Member States or third countries. <BR><BR>The Schengen Convention was signed by the same five States on 19 June 1990 but did not enter into force until 1995. It lays down the arrangements and guarantees for implementing freedom of movement. <BR><BR>The Agreement and the Convention, the rules adopted on that basis and the related agreements together form the "Schengen <I>acquis</I>". <BR>A protocol to the Treaty of Amsterdam governs the incorporation of the Schengen <I>acquis</I> into the Treaties. In order to provide a legal basis, incorporation entailed dividing the Schengen <I>acquis</I> under the first pillar (new Title IV - Visas, asylum, immigration and other policies related to the free movement of persons) of the Treaty establishing the European Communities or the third pillar (Title VI - Provisions on police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters) of the Treaty on European Union. The legal incorporation of Schengen into the Union was accompanied by integration of the institutions. The Council took over the Schengen Executive Committee and the Council's General Secretariat took over the Schengen Secretariat.<BR><BR>The protocol annexed to the Treaty of Amsterdam states that the Schengen <I>acquis</I> and the rules adopted by the institutions on the basis of that <I>acquis</I> must be adopted in their entirety by all applicant countries. <BR><BR>Schengen has gradually expanded: Italy signed up in 1990, Spain and Portugal in 1991, Greece in 1992, Austria in 1995 and Denmark, Finland and Sweden in 1996. Iceland and Norway are also parties to the Convention. <BR><BR>Ireland and the United Kingdom are not parties to the agreements, but, under the protocol to the Treaty of Amsterdam, they may take part in some or all of the provisions of this <I>acquis</I> if the 13 Member States which are parties to the agreements and the representative of the government of the country concerned vote unanimously in favour within the Council. In March 1999 the United Kingdom therefore asked to take part in certain fields of Schengen-based cooperation, including police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters, the fight against drugs and the Schengen Information System (SIS). The Council adopted the decision approving the request in May 2000. In June 2000 and November 2001 Ireland asked to take part in certain fields of Schengen activity, including all the provisions on the implementation and working of the SIS. The Council adopted the decision approving Ireland's request in February 2002. <BR><BR>Moreover, although already a signatory to the Schengen Convention, Denmark may choose in the context of the European Union whether to apply any new decision taken on the basis of the Schengen <I>acquis</I>. <BR><BR>See:<BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Area of freedom, security and justice">Area of freedom, security and justice</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Community acquis">Community acquis</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Free movement of persons ">Free movement of persons </A>(visas, asylum, immigration and other policies)<BR>•<A HREF="bword://Justice and home affairs (JHA)">Justice and home affairs (JHA)</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Pillars of the European Union">Pillars of the European Union</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Title VI of the EU Treaty">Title VI of the EU Treaty</A><BR><BR>
Screening	In May 1995 the White Paper on preparing the countries of Central and Eastern Europe for integration into the Union's single market drew up an initial table of the Community legislation that they will have to incorporate into their own law before joining the European Union.<BR><BR>In April 1998, analysis of the legislation of all the applicant countries except Turkey in the light of the Community <I>acquis</I> began. This first stage consisted of evaluating the compatibility of each applicant country's legislation with Community rules. This screening process was carried out jointly by the Commission and each of the applicant countries. Sector by sector, it allowed a road map to be drawn up for each applicant indicating which legislative instruments must be adopted or amended so that the future member will be able to adhere to Community legislation as soon as possible after accession. A technical assistance office, TAIEX, carried out a survey of the Community <I>acquis </I>and measures taken by the applicant countries in order to incorporate it into their own law.<BR><BR>The screening exercise was essential because it served as a basis for bilateral negotiations between the European Union and each of the applicant countries.<BR><BR>See:<BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Applicant countries">Applicant countries</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Community acquis">Community acquis</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Enlargement">Enlargement</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Incorporation of the Community acquis">Incorporation of the Community acquis</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://TAIEX (Technical Assistance Information Exchange Office)">TAIEX (Technical Assistance Information Exchange Office)</A><BR><BR>
Services of general economic interest	Services of general economic interest are commercial services of general economic utility, on which the public authorities therefore impose specific public-service obligations (Article 86 of the EC Treaty, formerly Article 90). Transport, energy and communications services are prime examples.<BR><BR>A new Article 16 has been written into the EC Treaty by the Treaty of Amsterdam, acknowledging the place occupied by services of general economic interest in the shared values of the Union and their role in promoting social and territorial cohesion. Article 16 also states that such services must operate on the basis of principles and conditions which enable them to fulfil their functions.<BR><BR>See:<BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://General-interest services">General-interest services</A> <BR>•<A HREF="bword://Public service">Public service</A> <BR>•<A HREF="bword://Public-service Charter">Public-service Charter</A> <BR>•<A HREF="bword://Universal service">Universal service</A><BR><BR>
Simplification of legislation	Simplifying legislation means weeding out the superfluous by rigorously applying the tests of whether it is necessary and proportionate. The exercise mainly involves the recasting and formal or informal consolidation of legislation.<BR><BR>This concept has grown in importance since the White Paper on the Completion of the Single Market and was explicitly put forward by the Edinburgh European Council in 1992. Over the past decade a concentrated effort has been made to establish a market guaranteeing the four freedoms, but this has meant a wealth of European legislation. Simplifying this mass of law has now become a priority in order to ensure that Community action is transparent and effective. A pilot programme (Simplification of Legislation for the Internal Market - SLIM) covering four specific areas was launched in May 1996 and will be extended to other areas.<BR><BR>A declaration on the quality of the drafting of Community legislation is attached to the Final Act of the Intergovernmental Conference (1997). It recommends that the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission lay down guidelines for improving the form of legislation.<BR><BR>On 5 June 2002, the Commission published the action plan "Better lawmaking" and undertook to "legislate less but better". The Council of Ministers is currently setting up a new working group to implement this plan. In parallel, the European Convention on institutional reform, set up following the Laeken Declaration, has a working group on the simplification of instruments and procedures. Members of this group have already alerted the Convention to the need to redouble efforts to recast and formally consolidate Community legislation and to improve legislative drafting in order to produce clear texts more consistent with existing legislation.<BR><BR>See:<BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Clarity of the Treaties (simplification of the Treaties)">Clarity of the Treaties (simplification of the Treaties)</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Consolidation of legislation - formal/official">Consolidation of legislation - formal/official</A> <BR>•<A HREF="bword://Consolidation of legislation - informal/declaratory">Consolidation of legislation - informal/declaratory</A> <BR>•<A HREF="bword://Recasting of legislation">Recasting of legislation</A> <BR>•<A HREF="bword://Subsidiarity">Subsidiarity</A> <BR>•<A HREF="bword://Transparency (access to documents)">Transparency (access to documents)</A><BR><BR>
Single institutional framework	The single institutional framework is the practical expression of the principle that there is only one set of institutions. It presupposes that Member States wishing to integrate and cooperate still further will agree to act through shared institutions. It also requires the other non-participating Member States to accept that shared institutions can be used for such operations to knit the Union closer together without involving all the Member States.<BR><BR>See:<BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Closer cooperation">Closer cooperation</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Pillars of the European Union">Pillars of the European Union</A> <BR>•<A HREF="bword://Social Policy Agreement">Social Policy Agreement</A> <BR><BR>
Social Charter	All the Member States except the United Kingdom adopted the Charter of the Fundamental Social Rights of Workers, commonly known as the Social Charter, in 1989 in the form of a declaration. It is seen as a political instrument containing "moral obligations" whose object is to guarantee that certain social rights are respected in the countries concerned. These primarily relate to the labour market, vocational training, equal opportunities and the working environment. It also contains an explicit request to the Commission to put forward proposals for translating the content of the Social Charter into legislation. The Social Charter has been followed up by social action programmes.<BR><BR>See:<BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Social dialogue">Social dialogue</A> <BR>•<A HREF="bword://Social policy">Social policy</A> <BR>•<A HREF="bword://Social Policy Agreement">Social Policy Agreement</A> <BR><BR>
Social Policy Agreement	The Social Policy Agreement was signed by 11 of the Member States in December 1991. The United Kingdom opted out. It sets out the policy objectives for which the 1989 Social Charter paved the way: promoting employment, improving living and working conditions, combating exclusion, developing human resources, etc. It also lays down the procedure for adopting social policy measures and acknowledges the vital part played by management and labour in this field.<BR><BR>When it was signed, this Social Policy Agreement was annexed to the Social Policy Protocol, the mechanism by which the United Kingdom allowed the other Member States to advance on the social policy front without taking part itself.<BR><BR>Following the election of a new government in May 1997, the United Kingdom announced that it intended to drop its opt-out. The Social Policy Agreement was then incorporated into the Social Chapter of the EC Treaty through the Treaty of Amsterdam. This also involved the formal abolition of the Social Policy Protocol.<BR><BR>See:<BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Single institutional framework">Single institutional framework</A> <BR>•<A HREF="bword://Social Charter">Social Charter</A> <BR>•<A HREF="bword://Social dialogue">Social dialogue</A> <BR>•<A HREF="bword://Social policy">Social policy</A> <BR><BR>
Social dialogue	Social dialogue is the term used to describe a joint consultation procedure involving the social partners at European level (UNICE, CEEP, ESC). It involves discussion, joint action and sometimes negotiations between the European social partners, and discussions between the social partners and the Union institutions.<BR><BR>It was started by the European Commission in 1985, and ever since the Single European Act the Treaty has formally required the Commission to develop the dialogue (Article 139, formerly Article 118b). So far the outcome has been fifteen joint opinions on (among other things) economic growth, the introduction of new technology, education, and vocational training. Social dialogue may also lead to contractual relationships, including agreements, the implementation of which is subject to a decision by the Council on a proposal from the Commission. There have been two agreements of this type between employers and labour to date - on parental leave and on part-time working.<BR><BR>Besides this ongoing dialogue between the two sides of industry, the Commission organised the first European Forum on social policy in March 1996, which brought together representatives of voluntary organisations, non-governmental organisations, trade unions, employers' organisations, the European Union institutions and the Member States.<BR><BR>See:<BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://European Economic and Social Committee (EESC)">European Economic and Social Committee (EESC)</A> <BR>•<A HREF="bword://Single institutional framework">Single institutional framework</A> <BR>•<A HREF="bword://Social Charter">Social Charter</A> <BR>•<A HREF="bword://Social partners">Social partners</A> <BR>•<A HREF="bword://Social policy">Social policy</A> <BR>•<A HREF="bword://Social Policy Agreement">Social Policy Agreement</A> <BR><BR>
Social partners	The Commission is required to consult various social partners when it wants to submit proposals in this field. This social dialogue occurs via the three main organisations representing the social partners at European level:<BR><BR>•the European Trade Union Confederation (ETUC),<BR>•the Union of Industries of the European Community (UNICE),<BR>•the European Centre for Public Enterprise (CEEP).<BR><BR>The Commission's job is therefore to take all necessary steps to encourage and facilitate consultation with the social partners on the future development of Community action and on the content of any proposals on the European Union's social policy, which is essentially concerned with the labour market.<BR><BR>A consultative assembly of economic and social partners in Europe was created as early as 1957 with the Treaty of Rome. Its role was to involve these various interest groups in building the common market. Its members are drawn from representatives of three categories: employers, workers and independent occupations. The Single European Act and the Treaty on European Union increased the number of areas in which this assembly, the Economic and Social Committee, must be consulted by the other institutions when they wish to introduce legislation in the social sphere.<BR><BR>See:<BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://European Economic and Social Committee (EESC)">European Economic and Social Committee (EESC)</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Social dialogue">Social dialogue</A><BR><BR>
Social policy	The Social Policy Agreement signed by eleven Member States has been incorporated into the EC Treaty by the Treaty of Amsterdam, so putting an end to a complex situation. From 1993 to 1999 there were two distinct legal bases for social policy measures: the EC Treaty itself and a separate agreement from which the United Kingdom had opted out. Now all social policy measures can be adopted on the basis of the new Title XI of the EC Treaty.<BR><BR>The objectives set by the Treaty draw on the 1961 European Social Charter and the 1989 Community Charter of the Fundamental Social Rights of Workers. They were already incorporated in the Social Policy Agreement and cover employment promotion, proper social protection, dialogue between management and labour, the development of human resources, and combating exclusion (Article 136).<BR><BR>Depending on the matter in had the Council decides:<BR><BR>•either by the codecision procedure after consulting the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions;<BR>•or unanimously on a Commission proposal after consulting the European Parliament, the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions.<BR><BR>See:<BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Consultation procedure">Consultation procedure</A> <BR>•<A HREF="bword://Cooperation procedure">Cooperation procedure</A> <BR>•<A HREF="bword://European Economic and Social Committee (EESC)">European Economic and Social Committee (EESC)</A> <BR>•<A HREF="bword://Qualified majority">Qualified majority</A> <BR>•<A HREF="bword://Single institutional framework">Single institutional framework</A> <BR>•<A HREF="bword://Social Charter">Social Charter</A> <BR>•<A HREF="bword://Social dialogue">Social dialogue</A> <BR>•<A HREF="bword://Social Policy Agreement">Social Policy Agreement</A> <BR>•<A HREF="bword://Unanimity">Unanimity</A> <BR><BR>
Stability and Growth Pact	The Stability and Growth Pact has to be seen against the background of the third stage of economic and monetary union, which began on 1 January 1999. Its aim is to ensure that the Member States continue their budgetary discipline efforts once the single currency has been introduced.<BR><BR>In practical terms the Pact comprises a European Council resolution (adopted at Amsterdam on 17 June 1997) and two Council Regulations of 7 July 1997 laying detailed technical arrangements (one on the surveillance of budgetary positions and coordination of economic policies and the other on implementing the excessive deficit procedure).<BR><BR>In the medium term the Member States have undertaken to pursue the objective of a balanced or nearly balanced budget and to present the Council and the Commission with a stability programme by 1 March 1999 (the programme will then be updated annually). Along the same lines, States not taking part in the third stage of EMU are required to submit a convergence programme.<BR><BR>The Stability and Growth Pact opens the way for the Council to penalise any participating Member State which fails to take appropriate measures to end an excessive deficit. Initially, the penalty would take the form of a non-interest-bearing deposit with the Community, but it could be converted into a fine if the excessive deficit is not corrected within two years.<BR><BR>See:<BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Convergence criteria">Convergence criteria</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Economic and monetary union (EMU)">Economic and monetary union (EMU)</A><BR><BR>
State aid	Article 87 (formerly Article 92) of the EC Treaty states that "any aid granted by a Member State or through State resources in any form whatsoever which distorts or threatens to distort competition by favouring certain undertakings or the production of certain goods shall, insofar as it affects trade between Member States, be incompatible with the common market."<BR><BR>The European Commission and the Court of Justice have placed a very broad interpretation on the concept of "aid" as regards the body granting it, which may range from the State itself to a regional or local authority, from a body over which the State directly or indirectly exerts a decisive influence to a private-sector enterprise or a public corporation, etc.<BR><BR>Accordingly, any advantage conferred by the State is regarded as state aid where:<BR><BR>•it confers an economic advantage on the recipient; <BR>•it is granted selectively to certain enterprises or products; <BR>•it may distort competition;<BR>•it affects trade between Member States.<BR><BR>The prohibition applies to a whole panoply of aid measures, whether direct (grants) or indirect (e.g. measures that relieve an enterprise of financial charges) and regardless of their basis or purpose. <BR><BR>However, an absolute prohibition of state aid is impossible and Article 87(2) and (3) provides for a number of exemptions for aid that is compatible with the common market and for aid that may be compatible under certain conditions. <BR><BR>On the basis of Article 88 (formerly Article 93) of the Treaty, the procedural Regulation on state aid stipulates that any aid or any aid scheme must be notified to the Commission and approved by it before being implemented. However, the prior notification requirement is relaxed by the Regulation on horizontal state aid, which authorises the Commission to exempt by way of regulation certain categories of aid including training aid, employment aid, aid for small and medium-sized enterprises and aid of minor importance. <BR><BR>By drafting new Community guidelines and frameworks, the Commission has clarified the conditions under which other forms of state aid pursuing horizontal objectives such as regional development aid, environmental aid and research aid may be granted.<BR><BR>See:<BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Competition">Competition</A><BR><BR>
Structural Funds and Cohesion Fund	The Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund are part of the Community's structural policy, which is intended to narrow the gaps in development among the regions and Member States of the European Union. The Funds participate fully, therefore, in pursuing the goal of economic and social cohesion.<BR><BR>The budget allocated to the Community's regional policy for the period 2000-06 is EUR 213 billion, comprising EUR 195 billion for the Structural Funds and EUR 18 billion for the Cohesion Fund. It represents 35% of the Community budget, and is therefore the second largest budget item.<BR><BR>There are four Structural Funds:<BR><BR>•The European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), set up in 1975, is the largest of these. It provides support for the creation of infrastructure, productive job-creating investment, mainly for businesses, and local development projects.<BR>•The European Social Fund (ESF), set up in 1958, contributes to the integration into working life of the unemployed and disadvantaged sections of the population, mainly by funding training measures.<BR>•The European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund (EAGGF), also set up in 1958 as a financing tool for the common agricultural policy, has two sections: a "Guidance" section providing support for rural development and aid for farmers established in areas lagging behind in their development and a "Guarantee" section financing common market organisations along with rural development measures in other parts of the Community;<BR>•The Financial Instrument for Fisheries Guidance (FIFG) was created in 1993. It seeks to adjust and modernise equipment and material in the sector and to diversify the economies of areas dependent on fishing.<BR><BR>In order to improve the effectiveness of Community action during the period 2000-06, the Commission communication "Agenda 2000" proposed an extensive reform of the structural policy whose financial implications were established at the Berlin Council meeting in 1999. This reform increased the concentration of assistance and simplified the procedures for its allocation and management by reducing the number of priority objectives to three:<BR><BR>•Objective 1 contributes to the development and structural adjustment of the regions whose development is lagging behind and which have a per capita GNP of less than 75% of the Community average; <BR>•Objective 2 supports the economic and social conversion of areas with structural difficulties such as those undergoing economic change, declining rural areas and areas dependent on fishing, problem urban areas, and geographical areas with serious natural or demographic handicaps;<BR>•Objective 3 supports the adjustment and modernisation of policies and systems of education, training and employment for regions outside the regions eligible for Objective 1.<BR><BR>In the same period, there are also four Community initiatives designed to try out new forms of development to deal with specific difficulties. They will receive 5.35% of the allocation for the Structural Funds:<BR><BR>•Interreg III has the goal of stimulating cross-border, transnational and inter-regional cooperation;<BR>•Leader + seeks to promote the socio-economic development of rural areas;<BR>•Equal provides for the development of new practices to fight against discrimination and inequalities of every kind in access to the labour market;<BR>•Urban II encourages economic and social regeneration of depressed cities and suburbs.<BR><BR>A Cohesion Fund was set up in 1993 to further strengthen the structural policy. It is intended for countries with a per capita GNP of less than 90% of the Community average, that is to say, Greece, Spain, Ireland and Portugal. The purpose of the Cohesion Fund is to grant financing to environment and transport infrastructure projects.<BR><BR>See:<BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Agenda 2000">Agenda 2000</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Economic and social cohesion">Economic and social cohesion</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://European Employment Strategy (EES)">European Employment Strategy (EES)</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Objectives 1,2 and 3">Objectives 1,2 and 3</A><BR><BR>
Subsidiarity	The subsidiarity principle is intended to ensure that decisions are taken as closely as possible to the citizen and that constant checks are made as to whether action at Community level is justified in the light of the possibilities available at national, regional or local level. Specifically, it is the principle whereby the Union does not take action (except in the areas which fall within its exclusive competence) unless it is more effective than action taken at national, regional or local level. It is closely bound up with the principles of proportionality and necessity, which require that any action by the Union should not go beyond what is necessary to achieve the objectives of the Treaty.<BR><BR>The Edinburgh European Council of December 1992 defined the basic principles underlying subsidiarity and laid down guidelines for interpreting Article 5 (former Article 3b), which enshrines subsidiarity in the EU Treaty. Its conclusions were set out in a declaration that still serves as the cornerstone of the subsidiarity principle. <BR><BR>The Treaty of Amsterdam has taken up the overall approach that follows from this declaration in a Protocol on the application of the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality annexed to the EC Treaty. Two of the things this Protocol introduces are the systematic analysis of the impact of legislative proposals on the principle of subsidiarity and the use, where possible, of less binding Community measures.<BR><BR>Each year the European Commission produces a report ("Better lawmaking") for the European Council and the European Parliament, which is devoted mainly to the application of the subsidiarity principle.<BR><BR>The Convention on institutional reform established by the Laeken Declaration in December 2001 is preparing, through its Working Group on "Subsidiarity", proposals with a view to taking more account of this principle without detracting from the aim of legislative simplification. It is suggesting the setting up of a political monitoring system (via an early warning system for national parliaments allowing them to deliver a reasoned opinion on a Commission proposal) or a judicial control system (creation of a subsidiarity chamber within the Court of Justice in order to strengthen ex post monitoring). The possibility of abolishing the Protocol on subsidiarity and replacing it by a number of articles in the new treaty has also been raised.<BR><BR>See:<BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Committee of the Regions (CoR)">Committee of the Regions (CoR)</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Delimitation of competences">Delimitation of competences</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://National parliaments">National parliaments</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Simplification of legislation ">Simplification of legislation </A><BR><BR>
Subsidiary powers	Article 308 of the EC Treaty (former Article 235) reflects the realisation by those who drafted the Treaty of Rome that the powers specifically allocated to the Community (executive powers) might not be adequate for the purpose of attaining the objectives expressly set by the Treaties themselves (competence ratione materiae). <BR><BR>This article can be used to bridge that gap, since it lays down that "If action by the Community should prove necessary to attain ... one of the objectives of the Community and this Treaty has not provided the necessary powers, the Council shall, acting unanimously on a proposal from the Commission and after consulting the European Parliament, take the appropriate measures."<BR><BR>Since this provision gives the European Parliament a purely consultative role which does not take into account Parliament's current legislative powers, its improper use could upset the institutional balance. To avoid this, use of Article 308 as a legal basis is often accompanied by other Treaty articles which accord Parliament a greater legislative role.<BR><BR>See:<BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Community powers">Community powers</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Council of the European Union">Council of the European Union</A> <BR>•<A HREF="bword://Delimitation of competences">Delimitation of competences</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Institutional balance and democratic legitimacy">Institutional balance and democratic legitimacy</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Subsidiarity">Subsidiarity</A><BR><BR>
Suspension clause	The suspension clause was written into the EU Treaty (Article 7) by the Treaty of Amsterdam. Under this clause, some of a Member State's rights (e.g. its voting rights in the Council) may be suspended if it seriously and persistently breaches the principles on which the Union is founded (liberty, democracy, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, and the rule of law). But its obligations would still be binding.<BR><BR>The Treaty of Nice added a preventive mechanism to this procedure. On a proposal by one third of the Member States, by the Commission or by the European Parliament, the Council, acting by a majority of four fifths of its members after obtaining the assent of the European Parliament, may determine that there is a clear risk of a serious breach of these fundamental principles by a Member State, and address appropriate recommendations to it.<BR><BR>See:<BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Charter of Fundamental Rights">Charter of Fundamental Rights</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Human rights">Human rights</A><BR><BR>
Sustainable development	The concept of sustainable development refers to a form of economic growth which satisfies society's needs in terms of well-being in the short, medium and - above all - long term. It is founded on the assumption that development must meet today's needs without jeopardising the prospects for growth of future generations.<BR><BR>The principle of integrating environmental concerns into the formulation and implementation of other policies, which is essential if we are to achieve sustainable development, was confirmed in the Maastricht Treaty.<BR><BR>In 1998 the Cardiff Summit laid the foundations for coordinated action on the Community plan to integrate these environmental concerns. Accordingly, the Commission presented a series of communications on the integration of the environment into, inter alia, the energy, transport, agriculture, internal market, development, industry, fisheries and economic policies. Some Council configurations also presented strategies for integrating the environment into their policies.<BR><BR>A European Union strategy for sustainable development was adopted in May 2001, and was given an external dimension by the global partnership for sustainable development which the Commission adopted in 2002.<BR><BR>At the World Summit on Sustainable Development held in Johannesburg in August-September 2002, new objectives, work programmes and timetables were approved in the areas of water, fisheries resources, oceans, chemicals, biodiversity, energy, sustainable production and consumption, and sustainable development strategies. The European Union committed itself to achieve objectives which go even further than those set in Johannesburg by the other participants.<BR><BR>See:<BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Competitiveness">Competitiveness</A> <BR>•<A HREF="bword://Energy">Energy</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Environment">Environment</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Globalisation of the economy">Globalisation of the economy</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Kyoto Protocol">Kyoto Protocol</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Precautionary principle">Precautionary principle</A><BR><BR>
TAIEX (Technical Assistance Information Exchange Office)|TAIEX|Technical Assistance Information Exchange Office	TAIEX, the Commission's technical assistance office, was created in response to a proposal in the White Paper on the preparation of the associated countries of Central and Eastern Europe for integration into the Union's internal market (May 1995). This service, managed by the European Commission, was originally intended to assist and inform the countries of Central and Eastern Europe on single market legislation so as to facilitate its implementation. Since 1997 it has covered all the applicant countries and the whole of the Community <I>acquis</I>.<BR><BR>TAIEX deals with the public administrations in the applicant countries and the Member States and private-sector associations. It provides the legal texts of the Community <I>acquis</I> and organises training seminars and visits by experts to countries which so request. It has a key role in the process of assessing whether the legislation of the applicant countries conforms with Community legislation (screening). It also assists the transposition and implementation of the <I>acquis</I> in the applicant countries.<BR><BR>TAIEX supplements Phare and other aid programmes since it responds to individual requests in areas of the <I>acquis</I> which are not covered by those programmes.<BR><BR>See:<BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Community acquis">Community acquis</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Enlargement">Enlargement</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Incorporation of the Community acquis">Incorporation of the Community acquis</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Programme of Community aid to the countries of Central and Eastern Europe (Phare)">Programme of Community aid to the countries of Central and Eastern Europe (Phare)</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Screening">Screening</A><BR><BR>
Taxation	Despite the introduction of a single market and economic and monetary union, there is still no genuine Community policy on taxation. Specific provisions are laid down in Articles 90 to 93 of the EC Treaty (former Articles 95 to 99), but the decision-making procedure for taxation requires a unanimous vote in the Council. Up to now this has acted as a brake on the adoption of common rules for direct and indirect taxation.<BR><BR>In order to avoid these obstacles, the Commission now encourages the use of the "closer cooperation" procedure introduced by the Treaty of Amsterdam and developed by the Treaty of Nice. This procedure enables the Commission to propose that a group of at least eight Member States may cooperate on a given matter after receiving the approval of the Council acting by qualified majority. It also encourages the Member States to adopt recommendations aimed at eliminating harmful tax obstacles, rather than binding legislative proposals.<BR><BR>Border controls on VAT were abolished with the introduction of the single market in 1993. Today, products are taxed in the country of purchase but eventually, when the final VAT system has been decided by the Council, they will be taxed in the country of origin. Furthermore, VAT and excise rates have been brought into closer alignment in the different Member States. <BR><BR>The adoption of the single currency is making it increasingly urgent to establish truly common rates of VAT and common rules for corporate taxation in the European Union. A code of conduct on business taxation ("tax package") was adopted by the Council in December 1997. Various Commission proposals are currently being scrutinised by the Council, notably on relations between associated companies, taxation of cross-border savings and a common VAT system.<BR><BR>See:<BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Closer cooperation">Closer cooperation</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Council of the European Union">Council of the European Union</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Customs Union">Customs Union</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Economic and monetary union (EMU)">Economic and monetary union (EMU)</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://European Commission">European Commission</A><BR><BR>
Telecommunications	With a view to completion of the internal market, telecommunications liberalisation emerged as a priority for the European Community in 1987 (Green Paper on the development of the common market for telecommunications services and equipment). In 1988, a directive opened up the telecommunications terminals markets to competition.<BR><BR>In the second phase of this development, a directive adopted in 1990 liberalised telecommunications services other than voice telephony. It was extended in 1994 to satellite communications and broadcasting services and then, in 1996, to cable television networks and mobile communications. At the same time, an open telecommunications infrastructure and services network (ONP) was put in place from 1990. The adoption of common rules allowed the conditions of access to the market for new operators to be harmonised. In 1993, the Council of Ministers decided to fully liberalise voice telephony services by 1 January 1998.<BR><BR>As of 1994, in the context of a developing 'Information Society', general liberalisation of telecommunications structures was presented as the way to develop multimedia. Various initiatives were adopted on the harmonisation of mobile (single European GSM standard) and satellite communications standards, and the integrated services digital network (ISDN).<BR><BR>In 1999, the European Commission began the huge task of recasting Europe's regulatory framework for telecommunications. The general aim was to improve access to the information society by striking a balance between regulation of the sector and Europe's competition rules. The new regulatory framework - also referred to as the "telecoms package" - is made up of five harmonising directives: the framework Directive, the Directive on access and interconnection, the Directive on authorisation, the Directive on universal service and users rights and the Directive on privacy. This was accompanied by the Decision of 2002 on radio spectrum policy and the Regulation, also adopted in 2002, on access to the local loop. The European Community is also actively promoting and supporting the deployment of third generation (3G) mobile communication.<BR><BR>See:<BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://eEurope">eEurope</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Information Society">Information Society</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Trans-European Networks (TEN)">Trans-European Networks (TEN)</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Universal Service">Universal Service</A><BR><BR>
Television without frontiers	The Television without Frontiers (TWF) Directive is the cornerstone of audiovisual policy in the European Community. Adopted in 1989 and amended in 1997, the Directive has two basic principles:<BR><BR>•the free movement of European television programmes within the internal market;<BR>•the requirement for TV channels to reserve, whenever possible, more than half of their transmission time for European works ("broadcasting quotas").<BR><BR>In parallel with these basic principles, the TWF Directive aims to safeguard certain important public interest objectives, such as cultural diversity, protection of minors (measures against programmes of a violent or pornographic nature) and the right of reply. Detailed rules on the content and frequency of television advertising have also been introduced. <BR><BR>Since June 2001, the TWF Directive has been undergoing a revision process. In this context, the European Commission is to publish a work plan setting out the themes for discussion and the relevant timetable.<BR><BR>See:<BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Audiovisual">Audiovisual</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Culture">Culture</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Public service">Public service</A><BR><BR>
Title V of the EU Treaty (CFSP)|CFSP|Title V of the EU Treaty	Title V of the EU Treaty, also known as the "second pillar", contains the provisions establishing a common foreign and security policy. It comprises Articles 11 to 28.<BR><BR>See:<BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Common foreign and security policy (CFSP)">Common foreign and security policy (CFSP)</A> <BR><BR>
Title VI of the EU Treaty	Introduced by the Treaty of Maastricht, Title VI of the EU Treaty - or the "third pillar" - contained provisions establishing cooperation on justice and home affairs.<BR><BR>The Treaty of Amsterdam has transferred a large number of fields which used to come under Title VI to a new Title IV of the EC Treaty ("Visas, asylum, immigration and other policies related to free movement of persons"). Police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters remains under Title VI of the EU Treaty, which now comprises fourteen articles (Articles 29 to 42).<BR><BR>Title IV of the EC Treaty and Title VI of the EU Treaty now constitute the legal bases for an area of freedom, security and justice.<BR><BR>See:<BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Area of freedom, security and justice">Area of freedom, security and justice</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Justice and home affairs (JHA)">Justice and home affairs (JHA)</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Pillars of the European Union">Pillars of the European Union</A><BR><BR>
Trans-European Networks (TEN)|TEN|Trans-European Networks	Since the Single European Act (1986), the smooth functioning of the single market has been indelibly linked to the objective of economic and social cohesion. However, the free movement of persons, goods and capital has not smoothed out regional and national disparities within the European Union. Accordingly, interconnection and interoperability of national infrastructure networks have emerged as key factors for the coherent planning of Community territory.<BR><BR>Title XV of the Treaty of Amsterdam provides the legal basis for Trans-European Networks (TEN). For the period 2000-2006 a total of 4.6 billion has been earmarked on the budget for TENs, to which must be added contributions from FEDER, the Cohesion Fund, the European Investment Bank (EIB) and the European Investment Fund (EIF).<BR><BR>Trans-European Networks exist in three sectors of activity:<BR><BR>•Transport TENs (TEN-T) with major priority projects covering road and combined transport, waterways and sea ports, as well as the European high-speed railway network. Intelligent transport management systems also fall in this category such as the Galileo satellite-based geographic positioning project.<BR>•Energy TENs (TEN-E) concern the electricity and natural gas sectors. Their objectives are to establish a single energy market and achieve security of supply.<BR>•Telecommunication TENs (eTEN) seek to deploy electronic services based on telecommunication networks. Strongly focused on public services, they are at the very heart of the eEurope "An Information Society for All" initiative.<BR><BR>The prospect of enlargement to the countries of Central and Eastern Europe has further strengthened the importance of TENs by extending their scope to the entire continent. Further afield, their efficient connection to the networks of third countries to the east (Russia and the countries of the CIS) or to the south (countries of the Mediterranean basin) will be conducive to economic development and equilibrium.<BR><BR>See:<BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Common transport policy">Common transport policy</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Economic and social cohesion ">Economic and social cohesion </A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://eEurope">eEurope</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://European Investment Bank (EIB)">European Investment Bank (EIB)</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Structural Funds and Cohesion Fund">Structural Funds and Cohesion Fund</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Telecommunications">Telecommunications</A><BR><BR>
Transparency (access to documents)|Transparency|access to documents	The term "transparency" is frequently used in Community language to mean openness in the working of the Community institutions. It is linked to a variety of demands for broader public access to information and EU documents, greater involvement in the decision-making process and more easily readable texts (simplification of the Treaties, consolidation and better drafting of legislation).<BR><BR>Complaints regarding a lack of transparency tend to reflect a general feeling that the European institutions are remote and secretive and that decision-making procedures are difficult for the ordinary European citizen to understand.<BR><BR>With specific reference to access to documents, the Council and the Commission adopted a code of conduct establishing common principles for the two institutions following a Council decision on 20 December 1993. On the basis of this code of conduct, the two institutions incorporated specific provisions on access to their documents into their rules of procedure.<BR><BR>The Treaty of Amsterdam has inserted a new Article 255 on transparency in the EC Treaty. This gives all citizens of the Union, plus all natural or legal persons residing or having their registered offices in a Member State, the right of access to European Parliament, Council and Commission documents. <BR><BR>This article was implemented by the Regulation of 30 May 2001, which is not significantly different from previous texts, in that it provides for two exceptions: cases in which access is automatically refused (for reasons of public security, defence, international relations) and cases in which access is refused except where there is an overriding public interest in disclosure (protection of commercial interests of a natural or legal person, for example).<BR><BR>See:<BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Consolidation of legislation - formal/official">Consolidation of legislation - formal/official</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Consolidation of legislation - informal/declaratory">Consolidation of legislation - informal/declaratory</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Clarity of the Treaties (simplification of the treaties)">Clarity of the Treaties (simplification of the treaties)</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Democratic deficit">Democratic deficit</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Governance">Governance</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Recasting of legislation">Recasting of legislation</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Simplification of legislation">Simplification of legislation</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Transparency of Council proceedings">Transparency of Council proceedings</A><BR><BR>
Transparency of Council proceedings	In the debate concerning the transparency of the Council's proceedings, attention is focused on two main points:<BR><BR>•public access to the Council's proceedings; <BR>•public access to Council minutes and the attached statements giving details of the voting. <BR><BR>Since amending its Rules of Procedure in December 1993, the Council has pursued the following policy: as a general rule, its deliberations remain secret but it holds some open debates (e.g. on the Presidency's six-monthly work programme). On the question of public access and details of the votes cast by Member States, the Council adopted (in October 1995) a Code of Conduct which enables the public to gain access whenever the Council is acting in its legislative role. The practical arrangements for such access were laid down by the Permanent Representatives Committee on 8 November, in a report concerning the internal procedure to be followed.<BR><BR>Under the Treaty of Amsterdam, a new Article on transparency was written into the EC Treaty (Article 255). It states that any citizen of the European Union and any natural or legal person residing or having its registered office in a Member State has a right of access to European Parliament, Council or Commission documents.<BR><BR>As a result of Article 255, which was implemented by the Regulation of 30 May 2001, the Council once again amended its Rules of Procedure. The general public can now consult the results and explanations of Council votes and all Council statements on the application or interpretation of legislation under preparation.<BR><BR>See:<BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Coreper">Coreper</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Council of the European Union">Council of the European Union</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Governance">Governance</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Transparency (access to documents)">Transparency (access to documents)</A><BR><BR>
Treaty of Amsterdam	The Treaty of Amsterdam is the result of the Intergovernmental Conference launched at the Turin European Council on 29 March 1996. It was adopted at the Amsterdam European Council on 16 and 17 June 1997 and signed on 2 October 1997 by the Foreign Ministers of the fifteen Member States. It entered into force on 1 May 1999 (the first day of the second month following ratification by the last Member State) after ratification by all the Member States in accordance with their respective constitutional requirements.<BR><BR>From the legal point of view, the Treaty amends certain provisions of the EU Treaty, the Treaties establishing the European Communities and certain related acts. It does not replace the other Treaties; rather, it stands alongside them.<BR><BR>See: <BR><BR>•<A HREF="http://europa.eu.int/scadplus/leg/en/s50000.htm">Amsterdam Treaty: a Comprehensive Guide</A><BR><BR>
Treaty of Nice	Adopted in December 2000, at the conclusion of the Nice European Council, and signed on 26 February 2001, the Treaty of Nice concluded the Intergovernmental Conference (IGC) that began in February 2000, the objective of which was to gear the working of the European institutions to the arrival of new Member States.<BR><BR>It opened the way to the institutional reform needed for the forthcoming EU enlargement with the accession of candidate countries from eastern and southern Europe. <BR><BR>The main changes it brings relate to limiting the size and composition of the Commission, extending qualified majority voting, a new weighting of votes within the Council and making the strengthened cooperation arrangements more flexible. In addition to discussions on these four key issues, other institutional questions were tackled: simplification of the treaties, the definition of powers, the integration of the Charter of Fundamental Rights and the role of the national parliaments. The Declaration on the Future of the Union, annexed to the Treaty, set out the next steps to be taken to deepen the institutional reforms and to make sure that the Treaty of Nice is just one stage in this process.<BR><BR>The Treaty of Nice has been ratified by all the Member States, in accordance with their respective constitutional rules, and came into force on 1 February 2003.<BR><BR>See: <BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Debate on the future of the European Union">Debate on the future of the European Union</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://European Convention">European Convention</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Intergovernmental Conference (IGC)">Intergovernmental Conference (IGC)</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Laeken Declaration">Laeken Declaration</A><BR>•<A HREF="http://europa.eu.int/scadplus/nice_treaty/index_en.htm">Treaty of Nice: a comprehensive guide</A><BR><BR>
Troïka	The "Troïka" consists of the Member State which currently holds the Presidency of the Council, the Member State which held it for the preceding six months and the Member State which will hold it for the next six months. The Troïka is assisted by the Commission and represents the Union in external relations coming under the common foreign and security policy.<BR><BR>The Troïka in its present form has been altered by the Treaty of Amsterdam and replaced by a system whereby the Presidency is assisted by the Secretary-General of the Council, in his capacity as High Representative for the common foreign and security policy, and by the Commission.<BR><BR>See:<BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Common foreign and security policy (CFSP)">Common foreign and security policy (CFSP)</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://High Representative for the CFSP">High Representative for the CFSP</A> <BR><BR>
Unanimity	The term "unanimity" refers to the requirement for all the Member States meeting in the Council to be in agreement before a proposal can be adopted. Since the Single European Act, the unanimity requirement has applied in a much more limited area than before. In the context of the first pillar, voting by qualified majority is now the rule. The second and third pillars, however, still operate largely according to the intergovernmental method and the unanimity requirement.<BR><BR>As some decisions are still taken by unanimity, and as this will become more difficult in an enlarged Europe, the Treaty of Nice has extended the scope of qualified majority voting to other areas and other provisions of Community policy and to a number of policies under the second and third pillars. <BR><BR>See:<BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Double majority">Double majority</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Common commercial policy">Common commercial policy</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Free movement of persons">Free movement of persons</A> (visas, asylum, immigration and other policies)<BR>•<A HREF="bword://Justice and home affairs (JHA)">Justice and home affairs (JHA)</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Pillars of the European Union">Pillars of the European Union</A> <BR>•<A HREF="bword://Qualified majority">Qualified majority</A> <BR>•<A HREF="bword://Single institutional framework">Single institutional framework</A> <BR>•<A HREF="bword://Treaty of Nice">Treaty of Nice</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Weighting of votes in the Council">Weighting of votes in the Council</A><BR><BR>
Uniform electoral procedure, Statute for Members of the European Parliament and for European political parties|Statute for Members of the European Parliament and for European political parties|Uniform electoral procedure	Article 190 of the EC Treaty (former Article 138) requires the European Parliament to draw up proposals for elections by direct universal suffrage under a uniform procedure in all the Member States, which is not the case at present (regional lists coexist with national lists). This would ensure that the different European political tendencies were more faithfully represented in the European Parliament. However, all concrete proposals along these lines in the past have foundered on national electoral traditions.<BR><BR>A common statute for all Members of the European Parliament, intended to eliminate differences in treatment between nationalities and ensure greater transparency - included in the Amsterdam Treaty at the request of the European Parliament - is still being negotiated between the Parliament and the Council. With the entry into force of the Treaty of Nice, the Statute will have to go before the Council for approval by qualified majority, with the exception of the provisions relating to taxation, which should give real prospects for agreement on a subject which has been pending since 1998.<BR><BR>The Treaty of Nice has supplemented Article 191 of the EC Treaty with a legal base allowing adoption, via the co-decision procedure, of a statute for European-level political parties governing, in particular, the criteria for their recognition and the rules governing their financing. A corresponding proposal is currently before the European Parliament.<BR><BR>See:<BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://European Parliament">European Parliament</A> <BR>•<A HREF="bword://Treaty of Nice">Treaty of Nice</A><BR><BR>
Universal service	Universal service is a concept developed by the Community institutions. It refers to the set of general interest demands to which services such as telecommunications and the mail should be subject throughout the Community. The aim is to ensure that all users have access to quality services at an affordable price.<BR><BR>See:<BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Economic and social cohesion">Economic and social cohesion</A> <BR>•<A HREF="bword://General-interest services">General-interest services</A> <BR>•<A HREF="bword://Public service">Public service</A> <BR>•<A HREF="bword://Public-service charter">Public-service charter</A> <BR>•<A HREF="bword://Services of general economic interest">Services of general economic interest</A> <BR><BR>
Weighting of votes in the Council	When a decision is taken by qualified majority in the Council, the weighting of votes is the result of a compromise between Member States which, although equal in law, differ in various respects. One factor determining the number of votes a Member State has is the size of its population, with an adjustment which leads to relative over-representation of the countries with a small population.<BR>This system has worked well so far, since it has given legitimacy to the decisions taken. With the current distribution of votes it is impossible for the "large" countries to combine to put the "small" countries in a minority and vice versa. This gives a guarantee that decisions taken by qualified majority have the broadest possible support.<BR><BR>With a view to enlargement, the last Intergovernmental Conference (IGC) implemented a revision of the scale of weightings to ensure that the relative weight of the "small" and "medium-sized" countries is not out of proportion to the size of their population. The number of votes of the most populous countries has thereby been increased further relative to the others, to enable the legitimacy of the Council's decisions to be maintained in terms of demographic representativeness. The new system of weighting will come into force on 1 November 2004.<BR>The IGC has also decided on the number of votes to be allocated to the new members after accession.<BR>As well as adjusting the number of votes, the Treaty of Nice has introduced the double majority system.<BR><BR>In the approach to enlargement, the question of the weighting of votes in the Council is closely linked to that of the number and nationality of the Commissioners and the extension of qualified majority voting. The greater the scope of qualified majority voting, the more beneficial fair weighting of the votes in the Council will be for decision-making, as it will avoid the risk of veto. On the question of the number and nationality of Commissioners, the "larger" countries have accepted losing their second Commissioner in return for a stronger voice within the Council.<BR><BR>See:<BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Composition of the European Commission">Composition of the European Commission</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Double majority">Double majority</A> <BR>•<A HREF="bword://Enlargement">Enlargement</A> <BR>•<A HREF="bword://Ioannina compromise">Ioannina compromise</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Qualified majority">Qualified majority</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Reinforced qualified majority">Reinforced qualified majority</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Unanimity">Unanimity</A><BR><BR>
Western European Union (WEU)|WEU|Western European Union	Set up in 1948 by the Treaty of Brussels, the WEU is a European organisation for the purposes of cooperation on defence and security. It consists of 28 countries with four different statuses: Member States, Associate Members, Observers and Associate Partners. All EU countries are full Member States except Denmark, Ireland Austria, Finland and Sweden, which have observer status. The six Associate Members are the Czech Republic, Hungary, Iceland, Norway, Poland and Turkey, and there are seven Associate Partners: Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia.<BR><BR>The Treaty of Amsterdam made the WEU an "integral part of the development of the Union" by giving it an operational capability in the field of defence. The WEU played a major role in the first Petersberg tasks, such as the police detachment in Mostar or cooperation with the police in Albania. However, it now seems to have abandoned that role in favour of developing the Union's own structures and capabilities in the sphere of the common foreign and security policy (CFSP). The transfer of the WEU's operational capabilities to the Union attest to this. The WEU's subsidiary bodies, the Security Studies Institute and the Satellite Centre, were hived off to the Union on 1 January 2002. The Treaty of Nice also deleted from the Treaty on European Union a number of provisions concerning relations between the WEU and the Union. The WEU's main remaining area of responsibility is Article V - collective defence. The transfer of that responsibility to the Union seems to have been deferred.<BR><BR>See:<BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Collective defence">Collective defence</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Common foreign and security policy (CFSP)">Common foreign and security policy (CFSP)</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://European security and defence identity">European security and defence identity</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://European Security and Defence Policy (ESDP)">European Security and Defence Policy (ESDP)</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organisation)">NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organisation)</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://'New look' NATO">'New look' NATO</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Petersberg tasks">Petersberg tasks</A><BR><BR>
White Paper	Commission White Papers are documents containing proposals for Community action in a specific area. In some cases they follow a Green Paper published to launch a consultation process at European level. Examples include the White Papers on the completion of the internal market, on growth, competitiveness and employment and the approximation of the laws of the associated states of Central and Eastern Europe in areas of relevance to the internal market. When a White Paper has been favourably received by the Council, it can become the action programme for the Union in the area concerned.<BR><BR>See:<BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Council of the European Union ">Council of the European Union </A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://European Commission">European Commission</A> <BR>•<A HREF="bword://Green Paper">Green Paper</A> <BR><BR>
eEurope	The eEurope initiative was launched by the European Commission in December 1999 and approved by the European Council of Lisbon (March 2000). The communication that was subsequently adopted under the title "eEurope - An Information Society for All", forms part of what is known as the Lisbon strategy which sets the objective for the European Union to become the world's most competitive and dynamic knowledge economy by 2010. The key objectives of the initiative are:<BR><BR>•bringing every citizen, home and school, every business and administration, into the digital age and online;<BR>•creating a digitally literate Europe, supported by an entrepreneurial culture open to information technology; <BR>•ensuring that the information society is socially inclusive.<BR><BR>In order to achieve these aims, the Commission adopted the <B>eEurope 2002</B> action plan in May 2000 which was approved by the European Council of Feira in June 2000. The main actions were intended to stimulate a cheaper, faster, secure Internet, promote human and financial investment and stimulate the use of the Internet.<BR><BR>The eEurope action plan was supplemented in June 2001 by the <B>eEurope+</B>action plan in the candidate countries, intended to accelerate reform and modernisation of the economies of the candidate countries, encourage the creation of institutional capacities, improve global competitiveness and strengthen social cohesion.<BR><BR>In June 2002, the European Council of Sevilla adopted the <B>eEurope 2005</B> action plan which follows up eEurope 2002. The new action plan is basically focused on the deployment of broadband access at competitive prices, network security and better use of information technology by public bodies ("eGovernment").<BR><BR>See: <BR><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Information Society">Information Society</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Telecommunications">Telecommunications</A><BR>•<A HREF="bword://Trans-European Networks (TEN)">Trans-European Networks (TEN)</A>
