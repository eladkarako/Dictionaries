586	The unofficial name given to the Pentium processor. Intel calls its new processor the Pentium because it was a marketable name and easily protected by copyright laws. Many people in the computer industry, however, referred to the Pentium processor as the 586 in reference to its predecessors, which were called the 286, 386, and 486. Also, the name given to Pentium-class processors produced by Intel Corporation competitors.
686	The name given to Pentium Pro-class processors produced by Intel Corporation competitors.
account	An area partitioned for a user of a particular host computer. To assure validity, account holders cannot gain access without using assigned login and password information.
address	An individualized name (or number) identifying a computer user or computer. Used in network communications for the transmission of messages for a particular person or machine.
ADO	(<I>ActiveX Data Objects</I>).
anonymous FTP	Internet <I>File Transfer Protocol</I> tool allowing you to connect to a site, search through available files, and download any file, document, or program without having to establish a user-id and password on the system where the material resides. By using the special user-id &quotanonymous", the network user will circumvent local security checks and have access to publicly accessible files on the remote system. Most systems that permit anonymous login require the user's <A href="bword://electronic mail">e-mail</A> address as the password.
API|Application Programming Interface	(<I>Application Programming Interface</I>) Interfaces that extend the capabilities of <A href="bword://Web server">Web servers</A> ; used by programmers to write applications that can interact with other applications. A server API is a published interface that lets software developers write programs that become part of the Web server itself. Usually these are DLLs (Windows dynamic load libraries) that are loaded into memory and stay resident at all times. Some common server APIs and the servers they support:<BR><BR><B>ISAPI</B> - Microsoft Internet Information Server<B>NSAPI</B> - Netscape Commerce and Enterprise Server<B>WSAPI </B>- O'Reilly Web Site and Web Site Pro<BR>
application	Software that executes a particular task, such as word processing or spreadsheet analysis.
Archie	A program used to search files at FTP sites; there are currently about 30 Archie servers in the world.
archive site	A mechanism that renders access to a collection of files across the Internet; also, a computer on which such a collection is stored.
ARPAnet|Advanced Research Projects Agency	(<I>Advanced Research Projects Agency</I>) The experimental network, established in the 1970s, where the theories and software on which the Internet is based were tested.
ASCII|American Standard Code for Information Exchange	(<I>American Standard Code for Information Exchange</I>) The standard method for encoding characters as 8-bit sequences of binary numbers, allowing a maximum of 256 characters. Text files are customarily called &quotASCII files".

BITNET	An acronym for "Because It's Time Network", a cooperative education and research network.
bookmark	(or favorite)<B> </B>Most Web browsers give you an option of adding a <A href="bword://URL">URL</A> to a &quotHotList" or by marking it with a &quotBookmark". By doing this, you can store the linking information (the URL) to any Web pages you plan to revisit. That way, if you decide to go back to a Web site, its URL is already catalogued and at your fingertips for easy reference. (Spry Mosaic uses &quotHotLists", Netscape Navigator uses &quotBookmarks" and Microsoft Internet Explorer uses &quotFavorites"). Other Web browsers may use those terms, or may call their URL-saving feature something else.)
Boolean logic	A system for searching and retrieving information from computers by using and combining terms such as AND, OR, and NOT to sort data.
bps|Bits Per Second	Bits Per Second. Refers to the speed at which a particular modem can transmit data. Divide the bits per second by 10 to get an approximate idea of how many characters per second a modem is transmitting data.

C shell	A user interface for those whose Internet providers offer only character-based, command-line access to a Unix system (hence the term "shell account").
CCITT V series	Several international modem standards set by the Consultative Committee for International Telephony and Telegraphy. The standards help buyers make sure modems they buy will communicate with other modems. The standards, formerly used primarily outside the United States, have been accepted almost universally since the advent of the 2400 bits per second (bps) modems. Not all are relevant to computer users. Examples include: V.21, V.22, V.22bis, V.23, V.26, V.26bis, V.27, V.27bis, V.27ter, V.29, <A href="bword://V.32">V.32</A> , <A href="bword://V.32bis">V.32bis</A> , <A href="bword://V.34">V.34</A> , <A href="bword://V.42">V.42</A> , <A href="bword://V.42bis">V.42bis</A> .

CGI|Common Gateway Interface	(<I>Common Gateway Interface</I>) A Web server scripting standard; a mechanism used to connect script to <A href="bword://Web server">Web servers</A> . In the past, most CGI programs were actually script files and were often written in scripting languages like PERL. Today, scripts can also be executable programs. You can write scripts in C and Visual Basic. The CGI specification has gone through several revisions. The best place to fine up-to-date information is the World Wide Web Consortium (W3) Web site (<A href="http://www.w3.org/">http://www.w3.org/</A> ).
channel	Virtual area where Internet Relay Chat <A href="bword://IRC">(IRC)</A> users communicate in real time. There are thousands of channels located on the Internet.
CIX|Commercial Internet Exchange	(<I>Commercial Internet Exchange</I>) A pact between network providers that allows them to do accounting for commercial traffic.

Cookie	Small bits of data that a Web page asks a browser to store on a user's computer, either in RAM or on the hard drive. Cookies have become a valuable way to keep track of a visitor's movements on your site, as well as a convenient method to customize content based on a visitor's past preferences. A Cookie, for instance, allows a Web site to &quotrecognize" and &quotremember" individual visitors by storing files on their browsers with a record of the last visit. Cookies cannot be used to &quotsee" any other data on the user's computer, nor can they determine the user's e-mail address or identity.
CoSN|Consortium of School Networks	(<I>Consortium of School Networks</I>) A nonprofit group whose members include K-12 teachers, hardware and software vendors, and Internet Service Providers <A href="bword://Internet access providers">(ISPs)</A> .
cracker	Someone who attempts to thwart computer security systems.
CRC|cyclic redundancy check	(<I>cyclic redundancy check</I>) An error-checking procedure for data transmission. The sending device performs a complex calculation, generating a number based upon the data being transmitted, and sends that number to the receiving device. The receiving device performs the same calculation after transmission. If the results match, the transmission succeeds. If the numbers don't match, it means the message was received in an altered state, and the data may be incorrect.
CRM|Customer Relationship Management	<I>(Customer Relationship Management) </I> Term used to describe the sophisticated personalization tools some vendors are developing to help define customer groups and target them with the right products and services.  Companies use web-based CRM products to help answer the question, &quotWho are my most profitable customers on the Web, and how do I target them more effectively?"
datagram	A formatted set of electronic data used in communication between computer systems. Datagrams consist of two parts: the data proper (which may be part of a longer message), and the header (which indicates the source, the destination, and the type of data).
DDN|Defense Data Network	(<I>Defense Data Network</I>) A segment of the Internet that links to US military bases and contractors around the world. Used for unsecured communications.
DECnet	A set of proprietary networking protocols utilized (instead of <A href="bword://TCP/IP">TCP/IP</A> ) by Digital Equipment Corporation's operating systems. These protocols are not compatible with the Internet.
DHTML	(<I>Dynamic HTML</I>).
dial-up	As opposed to a dedicated or <A href="bword://leased line">leased line</A> ; a type of computer linkage using regular telephone lines, generally referring to the kind of connection one makes when using a terminal emulator and a regular modem.

domain name	The text name corresponding to the numeric IP address of a computer on the Internet (i.e., <A href="http://www.oh-no.com/">http://www.oh-no.com/</A> ).
Domain Name System|DNS	(<I>DNS</I>) The unique name of a collection of computers connected to networks such as the Internet. A general-purpose, replicated, distributed data query service for looking up host IP addresses based on host names. The DNS is hierarchical, consisting of domains, subdomains, sites, and hosts. Unique names are formed from smallest to largest, and are of the form user@host.site.subdomain.domain, where host and site are often optional. On the Internet, domain names typically end with a suffix denoting the type of site:<BR><BR><B>.com</B> (commercial) <BR><B>.edu</B> (educational) <BR><B>.net</B> (network operations) <BR><B>.gov </B>(US government) <BR><B>.mil</B> (US military) <BR><B>.org</B> (organization) <BR><B>.us</B> (United States) <BR><B>.ca</B> (Canada) <BR><B>.uk</B> (United Kingdom) <BR><B>.au</B> (Australia) <BR><B>.cz</B> (Czech Republic) <BR><B>.xx </B>(where <B><I>xx</B></I> refers to another country's two-letter abbreviation)

dynamic HTML|DHTML	(<I>or DHTML</I>) Instructions written in HTML that enable Web pages to react to user input and produce content that changes each time it is viewed. With dynamic HTML coding, Web pages are created &quoton the fly", as the information is delivered to your desktop. There are many technologies for producing dynamic HTML, including CGI scripts, Server-Side Includes (SSI), cookies, Java, JavaScript, Cold Fusion and ActiveX.
Dynamic SQL	(see <A href="bword://SQL">SQL</A> ) This feature modifies queries based on user data, environment variables, and previously returned query results. Dynamic SQL can also increase processing efficiency by executing multiple queries and sending them to multiple databases from a single browser request.
dynamic Web page	Web pages that respond to users' requests and gather information from them. Oftentimes, they have built-in links to a relational database, from which they extract data based on input from the user (using dynamic SQL). Dynamic Web pages contain very little actual text. Instead, they pull needed information from other applications. Dynamic Web pages communicate with databases to extract employee directory information, spreadsheets to display accounting figures, client-server database management systems to interact with order processing applications, and more. Because a database already exists, why re-create it for Web page publications?
EARN|European Academic and Research Network	(<I>European Academic and Research Network</I>) The European equivalent to <A href="bword://BITNET">BITNET</A> .
eBusiness	(eMail, eCommerce, eZine, eSolution, eMarket, eService, etc.)  The "e" originally stood for "electronic", as in "online".  Today the term is used rather freely to describe any situation or solution that has made the migration from real world to the Internet.

FAQ|Frequently Asked Questions	<I>(Frequently Asked Questions).</I> A collection of questions and answers about a particular topic.
fiber optics	A method of transmitting light beams along optical fibers. A light beam, such as that produced in a laser, can be modulated to carry information.
file compression	This makes computer data smaller so less is needed to represent the same information and, consequently, the information takes up less disk or file space and may be transmitted in less time.
file server	A file-storage device on a local area network (LAN) that is accessible to all users on the network. It is sophisticated, also serving as a manager of sorts, maintaining order as users request files and make changes to them.
finger	A program used to find out if someone is online -- it may also reveal their full name and their plan and project files.
firewalls	Special computers that are set up on a network to prevent intruders from stealing or destroying confidential files.
flame	To heap written abuse on someone or to excessively criticize them for their ideas, spelling, grammar, etc. Flaming is considered impolite, juvenile behavior, but is not uncommon in some newsgroups.

FTP|File Transfer Protocol	<I>(File Transfer Protocol</I>). The principle of FTP is simple. You logon to a site (using your <B>FTP software</B>), then you choose a file to transfer. All FTP activity requires you to log on to the remote computer with a user name and password. To get to files shown on the map, it's important to understand the concept of <I>anonymous FTP</I>. Here, you log on to the machine as a guest rather than as an authorized account holder. In this situation, type &quotanonymous" as the user name and your full e-mail address as the password. Once you log on, you'll be able to access specified directories as an anonymous user. You can also access FTP sites with your Web browser. In the location or dialog box, type ftp://xxx.xxx.xxx, then click from directory to directory. But be warned: this procedure doesn't always work, and Web browsers tend to be much slower at file transfers than dedicated FTP clients.<BR>
FYI|For Your Information	(<I>For Your Information</I>) A subseries of RFCs that are not technical standards or descriptions of protocols. FYIs convey general information about subjects related to <A href="bword://TCP/IP">TCP/IP</A> or the Internet.
gateway	A computer that links two networks, routing IP <A href="bword://datagram">datagrams</A> and often converting protocols or messages from one network to the other. The term can also refer to a system capability that provides direct access to other remote networks or services.
Gopher	A menu-based system that allows a user to access information from a remote computer. Menu items point to a file or directory item, which may be located on the same computer or on a different one. Gophers essentially point to other gophers on remote machines. Through gopher, you can <A href="bword://Telnet">telnet</A> to remote computers and perform searches on searchable databases.
Graphical User Interface|GUI	A GUI (pronounced &quotgooey") is a graphics-based interface that lets you access programs by pointing to icons, buttons, and windows rather than by typing a string of commands at a command prompt.
helper applications	Additional software occasionally needed to help a Web browser program deal with an unusual file on the Internet. When an unusual file is downloaded, a helper application takes over for the Web browser to open and run the file. An example of a helper application is Netscape's "naplayer". It opens and plays sound files when they are encountered on the Internet.
hit	More than a <A href="bword://page view">page view</A> , a &quothit" is <I>any</I> action experienced at a web site. A &quothit" is <I>any</I> content delivered by a web server.  A single web page may place several dozen demands on the web server to deliver content: one for the page itself (or the collection of <I>pages</I> that make up a frame set), another for each graphic image displayed, and others for streaming media, sound bites and other content.  Each of those demands is considered a &quothit".  Every file a web server delivers is a &quothit".
Home page	The main page of a Web site. The home page provides visitors with an overview and links to the rest of the site. It often contains or links to a Table of contents for the site.
host	A computer system that is the source of network services; also the site where you can hold an interactive session.
HTML|Hyper Text Markup Language	<I>(Hyper Text Markup Language)</I>. A system of marking up, or tagging, a document so it can be published on the World Wide Web. An author incorporates HTML markup in his or her document to define the function (as distinct from the appearance) of different text elements. The appearance of these text elements is not defined at the authoring stage; instead, formatting is applied when a browser decides how it is going to display the text elements.
HTTP|HyperText Transfer Protocol	(<I>HyperText Transfer Protocol</I>) The client-server protocol upon which the World Wide Web is based.
hyperlink	A link that connects you to other documents, other places within the same document, pictures or HTML pages. Think of a hyperlink as an invitation to visit another place. A simple click on the link will take you there.
hypermedia	A blending of hypertext and multimedia.
hypertext	The links within one document that allows it to connect to and display another document. Selecting a hypertext link automatically displays the second document.
HYTELNET	A program that provides an easily adaptable and fluid connection to a multitude of networked information resources, including library catalogs.
IAB|Internet Architecture Board	(<I>Internet Architecture Board</I>) The &quotregulatory body" that makes decisions about standards and other vital issues.

An Intranet is nothing more than a private Internet. In other words, it is a private network, usually a LAN or WAN, that enables the use of Internet based applications in a secure and private environment. As on the public Internet, Intranets can host Web servers, ftp servers, and any other IP-based services.
IP|Internet Protocol	(<I>Internet Protocol</I>) Number 1 among the protocols upon which the Internet is based. IP allows a packet to travel through multiple networks on the way to its ultimate destination.

ISDN|Integrated Services Digital Network	<I>(Integrated Services Digital Network).</I> Special connections that use ordinary phone lines to transmit digital instead of analog signals. Briefly, ISDN is a telecommunications network that allows for digital voice, video, and data transmissions. ISDN replaces the slow and inefficient analog telephone system with a fast and efficient digital communications network. ISDN lines contain two channels: a B channel, which has a 64Kbps (kilobits per second) data transmission rate, and a D channel, which has either a 16Kbps or 64Kbps transmission rate. When the two lines are used together, transmitted data can travel at 128Kbps. Compare <A href="bword://ISDN">ISDN</A> and <A href="bword://T-1, T-3 line">T-1, T-3 lines</A> .

ISP|Internet Service Provider	(<I>Internet Service Provider</I>) An organization that lets users dial into its computers to connect to its Internet link for a fee. ISPs generally provide only an Internet connection, an electronic mail address, and maybe World Wide Web browsing software. You can use an ISP based in your town that offers an access number in your local calling area, or a national ISP that provides local-access numbers across the country (many of them also offer 1-800 dialing access). You can also connect to the Internet through a commercial online service, such as CompuServe or America Online. With this kind of connection, you get Internet access and the proprietary features offered by the online service, such as chat rooms and searchable databases. Internet access through online services may be more expensive than that obtained through an ISP.
