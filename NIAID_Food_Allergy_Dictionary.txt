Allergic Reaction	An immediate allergic reaction involves two actions of your immune system\n<ul>\n<li>Your immune system produces IgE. This protein is called a food-specific antibody, and it circulates through your blood.\n</li><li>The food-specific IgE then attaches to mast cells and basophils. Basophils are found in blood. Mast cells are found in body tissues, especially in areas of your body that are typical sites of allergic reactions. Those sites include your nose, throat, lungs, skin, and gastrointestinal (GI) tract.\n</li></ul>Generally, your immune system will form IgE against a food if you come from a family in which allergies are common —not necessarily food allergies but perhaps other allergic diseases, such as hay fever or asthma. If you have two allergic parents, you are more likely to develop food allergy than someone with one allergic parent.\n<br>If your immune system is inclined to form IgE to certain foods, you must be exposed to the food before you can have an allergic reaction.\n<br>As this food is digested, it triggers certain cells in your body to produce a food-specific IgE in large amounts. The food-specific IgE is then released and attaches to the surfaces of mast cells and basophils.\n<ul>\n<li>The next time you eat that food, it interacts with food-specific IgE on the surface of the mast cells and basophils and triggers those cells to release chemicals such as histamine.\n</li><li>Depending on the tissue in which they are released, these chemicals will cause you to have various symptoms of food allergy.\n</li></ul>Food allergens are proteins in the food that enter your bloodstream after the food is digested. From there, they go to target organs, such as your skin or nose, and cause allergic reactions.\n<br>An allergic reaction to food can take place within a few minutes to an hour. The process of eating and digesting food affects the timing and the location of a reaction.\n</li><li>If you are allergic to a particular food, you may first feel itching in your mouth as you start to eat the food.\n</li><li>After the food is digested in your stomach, you may have GI symptoms such as vomiting, diarrhea, or pain.\n</li><li>When the food allergens enter and travel through your bloodstream, they may cause your blood pressure to drop.\n</li><li>As the allergens reach your skin, they can cause hives or eczema.\n</li><li>When the allergens reach your mouth and lungs, they may cause throat tightness and trouble breathing.</li></ul><br>
Blood Test	Your healthcare provider can make a diagnosis by doing a blood test as well. Indeed, if you are extremely allergic and have severe anaphylactic reactions, your provider can’t use skin testing because causing an allergic reaction to the skin test could be dangerous. Skin testing also can’t be done if you have eczema over a large portion of your body.<br>Your healthcare provider may use blood tests such as the RAST (radioallergosorbent test) and newer ones such as the CAP-RAST. Another blood test is called ELISA (enzymelinked immunosorbent assay). These blood tests measure the presence of food-specific IgE in your blood. The CAP-RAST can measure how much IgE your blood has to a specific food. As with skin testing, positive tests do not necessarily mean you have a food allergy.<br>
Common Food Allergies	In adults, the foods that most often cause allergic reactions include:<br><li>Shellfish such as shrimp, crayfish, lobster, and crab</li>\n<li>Peanuts</li>\n<li>Tree nuts such as walnuts</li>\n<li>Fish</li>\n<li>Eggs</li><br>\n<b>The most common foods that cause problems in children are</B>:\n<li>Eggs</li>\n<li>Milk</li>\n<li>Peanuts</li>\n<li>Tree nuts<br>Peanuts and tree nuts are the leading causes of the potentially deadly food allergy reaction called anaphylaxis. <br> Adults usually keep their allergies for life, but children sometimes outgrow them. Children are more likely to outgrow allergies to milk, egg, or soy, however, than allergies to peanuts. The foods to which adults or children usually react are those foods they eat often. In Japan, for example, rice allergy is frequent. In Scandinavia, codfish allergy is common.\n<br>
Cross-Reactive Food Allergies	If you have a life-threatening reaction to a certain food, your healthcare provider will show you how to avoid similar foods that might trigger this reaction. For example, if you have a history of allergy to shrimp, allergy testing will usually show that you are not only allergic to shrimp but also to crab, lobster, and crayfish. This is called “cross-reactivity.”<br>Another interesting example of cross-reactivity occurs in people who are highly sensitive to ragweed. During ragweed pollen season, they sometimes find that when they try to eat melons, particularly cantaloupe, they experience itching in their mouths and simply cannot eat the melon. Similarly, people who have severe birch pollen allergy also may react to apple peels. This is called the “oral allergy syndrome.”<br>
Diet Diary	Sometimes your healthcare provider can’t make a diagnosis solely on the basis of your history. In that case, you may be a reaction. This diet diary gives more\ndetail from which you and your provider can see if there is a consistent pattern in your reactions<br>
Double-Blind Oral Food Challenge	The final method healthcare providers use to diagnose food allergy is double-blind oral food challenge.\n<li>\nYour healthcare provider will give you capsules containing individual doses of various foods, some of which are suspected of starting an allergic reaction. Or your provider will mask the suspected food within other foods known not to cause an allergic reaction.</li>\n<li>\nYou swallow the capsules one at a time or swallow the masked food and are watched to see if a reaction occurs.</li>\nIn a true double-blind test, your healthcare provider is also “blinded” (the capsules having been made up by another medical person). In that case your provider does not know which capsule contains the allergen.\nThe advantage of such a challenge is that if you react only to suspected foods and not to other foods tested, it confirms the diagnosis. You cannot be tested this way if you have a history of severe allergic reactions.\nIn addition, this testing is difficult because it takes a lot of time to perform and many food allergies are difficult to evaluate with this procedure. Consequently, many healthcare providers do not perform double-blind food challenges.\n<br> This type of testing is most commonly used if a healthcare provider thinks the reaction described is not due to a specific food and wishes to obtain evidence to support this. If your provider finds that your reaction is not due to a specific food, then additional efforts may be used to find the real cause of the reaction.\n<br>
Elimination Diet	The next step some healthcare providers use is an elimination diet. <br>\nIn this step, which is done under your provider’s direction, certain foods are removed from your diet.\n<li> You don’t eat a food suspected of causing the allergy, such as eggs.</li>\n<li>You then substitute another food—in the case of eggs, another source of protein.</li>\nYour provider can almost always make a diagnosis if the symptoms go away after you remove the food from your diet. The diagnosis is confirmed if you then eat the food and the symptoms come back. You should do this only when the reactions are not significant and only under healthcare provider direction. <br>\nYour provider can’t use this technique, however, if your reactions are severe or don’t happen often. If you have a severe reaction, you should not eat the food again.<br>
Exercise-Induced Food Allergy	At least one situation may require more than simply eating food with allergens to start a reaction: exercise-induced food allergy. People who have this reaction only experience it after eating a specific food before exercising. Some people get this reaction from many foods, and others get it only after eating a specific food. As exercise increases and body temperature rises, itching and light-headedness start and allergic reactions such as hives may appear and even anaphylaxis may develop.\n<br>The management of exercised-induced food allergy is simple — avoid eating for a couple of hours before exercising.<br>
Food Allergy	Food allergy is an abnormal response to a food triggered by the body’s immune system. In this pamphlet, food allergy refers to a particular type of response of the immune system in which the body produces what is called an allergic, or IgE, antibody to a food. (IgE, or immunoglobulin E, is a type of protein that works against a specific food.)<br>Allergic reactions to food can cause serious illness and, in some cases, death. Therefore, if you have a food allergy, it is extremely important for you to work with your healthcare provider to find out what food(s) causes your allergic reaction.<br>Sometimes, a reaction to food is not an allergy at all but another type of reaction called “food intolerance.”<br>Food intolerance is more common than food allergy. The immune system does not cause the symptoms of food intolerance, though these symptoms may look and feel like those of a food allergy.<br>
Food Allergy Introduction	Food allergy affects up to 6 to 8 percent of children under the age of 3 and close to 4 percent of adults. If you have an unpleasant reaction to something you have eaten, you might wonder if you have a food allergy. One out of three people either believe they have a food allergy or modify their or their family’s diet. Thus, while food allergy is commonly suspected, healthcare providers diagnose it less frequently than most people believe.<br>This <a href="http://www3.niaid.nih.gov/topics/foodAllergy/PDF/foodallergy.pdf">pamphlet</a> describes allergic reactions to foods and their possible causes as well as the best ways to diagnose and treat allergic reactions to food. It also describes other reactions to foods, known as food intolerances, which can be confused with food allergy, and describes some unproven and controversial food allergy theories.<br>
Food Allergy in Infants and Children	Allergy to cow’s milk is particularly common in infants and young children. It causes hives and asthma in some children. In others, it can\nlead to colic and sleeplessness, and perhaps blood in the stool or poor growth. Infants are thought to be particularly susceptible to this allergic\nsyndrome because their immune and digestive systems are immature. Milk allergy can develop within days to months of birth.\n<br>If your baby is on cow’s milk formula, your healthcare provider may suggest a change to soy formula or an elemental formula if possible. Elemental formulas are produced from processed proteins with supplements added (basically sugars and amino acids). There are few if any allergens within these materials.\n<br>Healthcare providers sometimes prescribe glucocorticosteroid medicines to treat infants with very severe GI reactions to milk formulas. Fortunately, this food allergy tends to go away within the first few years of life.\n<br>Breast feeding often helps babies avoid feeding problems related to allergic reactions. Therefore, health experts often suggest that mothers feed their baby only breast milk for the first months of life to avoid milk allergy from developing within that timeframe.\n<br>Some babies are very sensitive to a certain food. If you are nursing and eat that food, sufficient amounts can enter your breast milk to cause a food reaction in your baby. To keep possible food allergens out of your breast milk, you might try not eating those foods, such as peanuts, that could cause an allergic reaction in your baby.\n<br>There is no conclusive evidence that breastfeeding prevents allergies from developing later in your child’s life. It does, however, delay the start of food allergies by delaying your infant’s exposure to those foods that can prompt allergies. Plus, it may avoid altogether food allergy problems sometimes seen in infants.\n<br>By delaying the introduction of solid foods until your baby is 6 months old or older, you can also prolong your baby’s allergy-free period. Speak to your healthcare provider for specific instructions on when to add specific food groups to your child’s diet.\n<br>
Food additives	Another type of food intolerance is a reaction to certain products that are added to food to enhance taste, provide color, or protect against the growth of microbes. Several chemical compounds, such as MSG (monosodium glutamate) and sulfites, are tied to reactions that can be confused with food allergy.<br>
Food poisoning	One possible cause of symptoms like those of food allergy is food contaminated with microbes, such as bacteria, and bacterial products, such as toxins. Contaminated meat and dairy products sometimes cause symptoms, including GI discomfort, that resemble a food allergy when it is really a type of food poisoning.<br>
GI tract	an area of the body that includes the stomach and intestines.<br>
Gluten intolerance	Gluten intolerance is associated with the disease called “gluten-sensitive enteropathy” or “celiac disease.” It happens if your immune system responds abnormally to gluten, which is a part of wheat and some other grains. Some researchers include celiac disease as a food allergy. This abnormal immune system response, however, does not involve IgE antibody.<br>
Histamine toxicity	There are substances, such as the powerful chemical histamine, present in certain foods that cause a reaction similar to an allergic reaction. For example, histamine can reach high levels in cheese, some wines, and certain kinds of fish such as tuna and mackerel.<br>In fish, histamine is believed to come from contamination by bacteria, particularly in fish that are not refrigerated properly. If you eat one of these foods with a high level of histamine, you could have a reaction that strongly resembles an allergic reaction to food. This reaction is called “histamine toxicity.”<br>
Lactose intolerance	Another cause of food intolerance confused with a food allergy is lactose intolerance or lactase deficiency. This common food intolerance affects at least 1 out of 10 people.<br>Lactase is an enzyme that is in the lining of your gut. Lactase breaks down or digests lactose, a sugar found in milk and most milk products.<br>Lactose intolerance, or lactase deficiency, happens when there is not enough lactase in your gut to digest lactose. In that case, bacteria in your gut use lactose to form gas which causes bloating, abdominal pain, and sometimes diarrhea.<br>Your healthcare provider can use laboratory tests to find out whether your body can digest lactose.<br>
MSG	MSG (monosodium glutamate) is a flavor enhancer and, when taken in large amounts, can cause some of the following signs: <li>Flushing</li><br>\n<li>Sensations of warmth</li><br>\n<li>Headache</li><br>\n<li>Chest discomfort</li><br>\n<li>Feelings of detachment</li><br><br>\nThese passing reactions occur rapidly after eating large amounts of food to which MSG has been added.<br>
Other causes	There are several other conditions, including ulcers and cancers of the GI tract, that cause some of the same symptoms as food allergy. These symptoms include vomiting, diarrhea, and cramping abdominal pain made worse by eating.<br>
Psychological causes	Some people may have a food intolerance that has a psychological trigger. If your food intolerance is caused by this type of trigger, a careful psychiatric evaluation may identify an unpleasant event in your life, often during childhood, tied to eating a particular food. Eating that food years later, even as an adult, is associated with a rush of unpleasant sensations.<br>
Skin Test	If your history, diet diary, or elimination diet suggests a specific food allergy is likely, your healthcare provider will then use either the scratch or the prick skin test to confirm the diagnosis.<br>During a scratch skin test, your healthcare provider will place an extract of the food on the skin of your lower arm. Your provider will then scratch this portion of your skin with a needle and look for swelling or redness, which would be a sign of a local allergic reaction.<br>A prick skin test is done by putting a needle just below the surface of your skin of the lower arm. Then, a tiny amount of food extract is placed under the skin.<br>If the scratch or prick test is positive, it means that there is IgE on the skin’s mast cells that is specific to the food being tested. Skin tests are rapid, simple, and relatively safe.<br>You can have a positive skin test to a food allergen, however, without having an allergic reaction to that food. A healthcare provider diagnoses a food allergy only when someone has a positive skin test to a specific allergen and when the history of reactions suggests an allergy to the same food.<br>
Sulfites	Sulfites in high concentrations sometimes pose problems for people with severe asthma. Sulfites can give off a gas called sulfur dioxide that a\nperson with asthma inhales while eating food containing sulfites. This gas irritates the lungs and can send an asthmatic into\nsevere bronchospasm, a tightening of the lungs.<br>\nThe Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has banned sulfites as spray-on preservatives in fresh fruits and vegetables. Sulfites are still used in some foods,\nhowever, and occur naturally during the fermentation of wine. <br>Sulfites occur naturally in foods or may be added to increase crispness or prevent mold growth.<br>
