Wave Division Multiplexing (WDM)|wave-division-multiplexing	A means of multiplexing different wavelengths of light onto the same physical fiber-optic communications line pair, allowing up to a 40x increase in bandwidth. A single wavelength of light limits a T1 line to 1.4 Mb/s (+/- allowing for clocking); using different wavelengths of light allow the same fiber pair to carry 60Mb/s of data.

Windows Internet Naming Service (WINS)|windows-internet-naming-service	A system that determines the IP address associated with a particular network computer. This is called name resolution. WINS supports network client and server computers running Windows and can provide name resolution for other computers with special arrangements. Determining the IP address for a computer is a complex process when <A href="bword://Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)">DHCP </A>servers assign IP addresses dynamically. For example, it is possible for DHCP to assign a different IP address to a client each time the machine logs on to the network.

NTFS has features to improve reliability, such as transaction logs to help recover from disk failures. To control access to files, you can set permissions for directories, individual files, or both. NTFS files are not accessible from other operating systems such as <A href="bword://Disk Operating System (DOS)">DOS </A>.
