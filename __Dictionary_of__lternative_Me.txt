According to its theory, maintaining alignment of the head, neck, and back leads to optimum overall physical functioning. Frederick Matthias Alexander (1869-1955), an Australian Shakespearean actor, developed the method at the turn of the century and wrote The Resurrection of the Body. Although his original purpose was to assist voice projection, Alexander concluded that faulty posture was responsible for diverse symptoms. He posited that habitual unbalanced movement affects the functioning of the entire body, implying that postures entail behavior patterns and that bad postural habits can distort one's personality. Alexander further posited that all proper bodily movements flowed from one basic movement, the maximum lengthening of the spine, which he termed the "primary control." He stated that, in a sense, his method embraced all religions, and he posited an "all-wise" invisible "Authority" within the "soul of man."

Anthroposophical medicine, a purported "extension of practical medicine," encompasses curative eurythmy. According to anthroposophy, the human organism consists of a physical body, a vegetal "etheric" body, an animalistic "astral" or "soul" body, and an "ego" or "spirit." Anthroposophical "remedies" supposedly smooth the interaction of these components.

Detroit chiropractor George J. Goodheart, Jr., developed the first AK procedure (the origin and insertion technique) in 1964. He theorized that muscle groups share "energy pathways" with internal organs and that, therefore, every organ dysfunction is discoverable in a related muscle. Testing muscles for relative strength and tone supposedly taps the body's "innate intelligence" and enables practitioners to detect specific dysfunctions. AK encompasses: "clinical nutrition"; CranioSacral Therapy; "dietary management"; homeopathy, including classical homeopathy; meridian therapy (see "Ching Lo"), especially acupressure and acupuncture; and reflexology.
aqua acupuncture (aqua acupuncture therapy, aquapuncture, the injection therapy)|aqua acupuncture|aqua acupuncture therapy|aquapuncture|the injection therapy	Form of acupuncture that involves the hypodermic injection of substances (e.g., vitamin preparations or liquid herbal extracts) at acupuncture points, purportedly to "stimulate" them by pressure from the injected substance.

aromatherapy (aromatic medicine, conventional aromatherapy, holistic aromatherapy)|aromatherapy|aromatic medicine|conventional aromatherapy|holistic aromatherapy	"Branch" of herbal medicine that centers on using fragrant substances, particularly oily plant extracts, to alter mood or to improve individuals' health or appearance. The alleged benefits of aromatherapy range from stress relief to enhancement of immunity and the unlocking of "emotions from past experiences." Although aromatherapy has ancient roots, proponents did not call it "aromatherapy" before the 1930s. The expression "aromatherapy" is an umbrella used by the cosmetics, fragrance, and alternative-medicine industries. It derives from the French word aromatherapie, coined by Rene Maurice Gattefosse, a French chemist whose book of the same name was published in 1928. After a lab explosion Gattefosse conveniently plunged his badly burned hand into a vat of lavender oil. He noticed how well it healed, and thus began the development of modern aromatherapy, which French homeopaths Dr. and Mme. Maury revived in the 1960s. <BR><BR>  In the aromatherapy industry the odorous substances of choice are essential oils (oils that are volatile, aromatic, and flammable) from flowers, fruits, grasses, leaves, roots, and wood resins. Manners of use of such oils include sniffing, ingestion, addition to bathwater, and application to the skin (typically with massage). One of aromatherapy's postulates is that essential oils have a "spiritual dimension" and can restore "balance" and "harmony" both to one's body and to one's life. One of its principles, the "doctrine of signatures," holds that a plant's visible and olfactory characteristics reveal its "secret" qualities. For example, because the configuration of the violet suggests shyness, aromatherapists hold that its scent engenders calmness and modesty. Some proponents have characterized essential oils as the soul or spirit of plants.
aromics(TM) (aromics(TM) program)|aromics|aromics program|aromics(TM) program	Combination of aromatherapy and NLP promoted in 1993 by Bill McMahan of Santa Ana, California.

Counseling	Purported unique "approach to facilitation" promoted by the American Society of Alternative Therapists (ASAT(TM)), in Rockport, Massachusetts. The method allegedly heals people through "the ultimate means of all causation." Its theory posits an unlimited human capacity for "conscious creation of life."

Its theory posits "etheric contacts" and a "White Light" with "magnetic energies."
Aston Movement	Mode of bodywork developed by Judith Aston, the founder of Aston-Patterning. One of its postulates is that bodily "patterns"--ways of moving, areas of ease, and areas of discomfort--reveal everyone's history of attitude, injury, and physical activity.
Aston-Patterning(R)|Aston-Patterning	Form of "movement reeducation" developed by Judith Aston. Its purported design is to teach people how to live optimally in their bodies.

astrologic medicine (astral healing, astrological healing, astromedicine, medical astrology, medicinal astrology)|astral healing|astrologic medicine|astrological healing|astromedicine|medical astrology|medicinal astrology	System based on cosmobiology--an alleged science whose postulate is that specific mental and physical conditions correspond to the relative positions of celestial bodies. Astrologic medicine involves horoscopic astrology and the "zodiacal man" doctrine. The postulate of horoscopic astrology--also called "genethliacal astrology," "horoscopy," "natal astrology," "popular astrology," and "sun sign astrology"--is that the relationship between the positions of planets and stars and the moment of one's birth determines lifelong personality. According to the "zodiacal man" doctrine, each of the twelve signs ("houses") of the zodiac--constellations named Aries, Taurus, etc.--governs a different part of the human body. Proponents associate these zodiacal signs ("sun signs") with bodily parts (e.g., organs) and systems and with predisposition to disease in different bodily parts. Certain "planetary configurations" supposedly can trigger disease in susceptible persons. Some proponents further posit a correlation of (a) sun signs and particular herbs, and (b) sun signs and the twelve "cell salts" of the Schuessler biochemic system of medicine. Astrologic medicine includes astrodiagnosis (see "astrological diagnosis"), prognosis, selection and timing of treatments (especially homeopathic "remedies"), and alleged preventive medicine.

aura	Alleged generally invisible envelope of "vital energy."
aura analysis (aura reading, auric diagnosis)|aura analysis|aura reading|auric diagnosis	Supposed direct or indirect examination of the "vital energy" that allegedly envelops each human. Proponents claim that this "aura" is perceptible to clairvoyants or psychics. "Nonpsychics" purportedly can analyze it through Kirlian photography or a Kilner screen. Dr. Walter J. Kilner (1847-1920) of St. Thomas's Hospital, in London, invented this screen: two plates of glass, an eighth of an inch apart, containing an alcoholic solution of a dye (usually carmine or a coal-tar dye). "Auric" colors supposedly reveal the personal traits of the subject, such as impressionableness and "spiritual arrogance." Proponents also associate "auric" colors with glands, organs, organ systems, and psychological states such as anger and boredom.
aura and vibrational diagnosis	Mode of Natural and Macrobiotic Medicine that is a form of aura analysis.
aura balancing (aura cleansing, aura clearing, aura healing, auric healing)|aura balancing|aura cleansing|aura clearing|aura healing|auric healing	Multiform method characterized by purported treatment of the "energy field" ("aura") around a person's head or body.

Fisslinger, the German author of Aura Imaging Photography, Aura Mastery, and Aura Visions, and by "researcher" Guy Coggins, author of Aura Awareness: What Your Aura Says About You. Aura Imaging is a purported means of reading the "true character" of individuals. It involves using an "aura camera" that can produce instant photos. The color, shape, and size of the "auric image" allegedly can indicate specific physical, emotional, and spiritual conditions. Aura Imaging theory posits chakras ("energy centers" that correspond to endocrine glands) and "vital energy."

auriculotherapy (auricular acupuncture, auricular therapy, ear acupuncture)|auricular acupuncture|auricular therapy|auriculotherapy|ear acupuncture	Form of homuncular acupuncture developed by Dr. P.F.M. Nogier of France. Its theory depicts the auricle (the outer portion of the ear) as an upside-down fetus with points that correspond to bodily parts. Such points number more than two hundred. Ostensible diagnosis involves examining the ear for tenderness or for variations in electrical conductivity. Treatment consists in the acupuncturing or supposed electrical stimulation of the auricular acupoint that "corresponds" to the anatomical site of the malady.

This alleged ability stems from a hypothetical part of consciousness that proponents call "SOURCE."
Awareness Release Technique(R) (A.R.T.)|A.R.T.|Awareness Release Technique	Component of Advanced Energy Healing. A.R.T. purportedly is a result of Dr. Robert T. Jaffe's discovery that "psychological issues" alter the "human energy field" and cause disease. Its theory apparently posits "subtle energies" and a "third eye," which enables clairvoyance. It is an alleged means of finding and "releasing" the "core" of a disease.

Ayurveda (ancient Indian medicine, Ayurveda Medicine, Ayurv|Ayurv|Ayurveda|Ayurveda Medicine|ancient Indian medicine	Allegedly, the "most complete" system of "natural medicine" and the "mother of all healing arts." Ayurvedic theory posits a "subtle anatomy" that includes: (a) nadis, "canals" that carry prana ("cosmic energy") throughout the body; (b) chakras, "centers of consciousness" that connect body and soul; and (c) marmas, points on the body beneath which "vital structures" (physical and/or "subtle") intersect. Ayurvedic ostensible diagnosis involves examination of the eyes, face, lips, tongue, nails, and pulse. Ayurvedists associate parts of the lips and tongue, for example, with internal organs and maintain that discolorations, lines, cracks, and irritability in various areas indicate disorders in "corresponding" organs. The pulse is important because of the belief that the heart is the seat of the underlying intelligence of nature: allegedly, human consciousness. (See "classical Indian medicine.")
Ayurvedic Acupuncture (Bhedan Karma, traditional Indian acupuncture)|Ayurvedic Acupuncture|Bhedan Karma|traditional Indian acupuncture	Subject of The Lost Secrets of Ayurvedic Acupuncture: An Ayurvedic Guide to Acupuncture (1994), by Frank Ros, "A.M.D." (probably "Doctor of Ayurvedic Medicine"), D.Ac.

Ayurvedic Facial	Purportedly, a "therapeutic skin care experience" that involves the use of "dosha-specific" products and a facial massage focusing on "marma points."
Ayurvedic nutrition (Ayurvedic diet)|Ayurvedic diet|Ayurvedic nutrition	Nutritional phase of Ayurveda. It involves eating according to (a) one's "body type" and (b) the "season." The alleged activity of the doshas--three "bodily humors," "dynamic forces," or "spirits that possess"--determines one's "body type." In Ayurveda, "body types" number seven, eight, or ten, and "seasons" traditionally number six. Each two-month season corresponds to a dosha; for example, the two seasons that correspond to the dosha named "Pitta" (see "Raktamoksha") constitute the period of mid-March through mid-July. But some proponents enumerate three seasons: summer (when pitta predominates), autumn, and winter (the season of kapha); or Vata season (fall and winter), Kapha season (spring), and Pitta season (summer). According to Ayurvedic theory, one should lessen one's intake of foods that increase ("aggravate") the ascendant dosha.
Ayurvedic Reflexology-Acupressure	Service offered by the Dr. Guervaz Ayurveda Center, in New York City. Its purported design is to open "channels" and "meridians."

Bach flower therapy (Bach flower essence method, Bach flower essence system)|Bach flower essence method|Bach flower essence system|Bach flower therapy	Quasi-homeopathic system of ostensible diagnosis and treatment developed in the 1930s by British physician Edward Bach (1886-1936). Bach put forth his philosophy in Heal Thyself: An Explanation of the Real Cause and Cure of Disease, first published in 1931. Therein he described five "fundamental truths," in sum: (1) Souls, invincible and immortal sparks of the Almighty, are the "real," "Higher" selves of humans. (2) Humanity's purpose is to develop virtues and wipe out all intrapersonal wrongs. Souls know what circumstances conduce to the perfection of human nature. (3) One's lifetime is a minuscule part of one's evolution. (4) When one's "Soul" and personality are "in harmony," one is healthy and happy. The straying of the personality from the dictates of the "Soul" is the "root cause" of disease and unhappiness. (5) The "Creator of all things" is "Love," and everything of which humans are conscious manifests the "Creator." Bach held that disease was essentially beneficial and that its design was to subject the personality to the "Divine will" of the "Soul." Supposedly, he "psychically" discovered the specific "healing" effects of 38 wildflowers. The life force ("soul quality" or "energy wavelength") of each of these flowers allegedly is transferable to water and thence to humans. Each of the so-called Bach flower remedies is a liquid that supposedly contains a "soul quality" with an affinity to a human "soul quality"; and each vegetable "soul quality" allegedly harmonizes its human counterpart with the "Soul." The bases of classical "diagnosis" are conversation and intuition. Administration of the "remedies" is usually oral but may be external.

Theoretically, this enhances tongue acupuncture and TCM tongue diagnosis. Yoshiaki Omura, M.D., Sc.D., developed the method in New York City. It includes the Direct Bi-Digital O-Ring Test Method and the Indirect "Bi-Digital O-Ring Test." Omura has promoted the method worldwide, and there are "O-ring societies" in Europe and Japan.
biblical counseling (nouthetic counseling)|biblical counseling|nouthetic counseling	Use of devotional instructions in the Bible to treat psychological problems. Proponents equate psychological and spiritual problems and claim that all such troubles are solvable merely by cultivating obedience to Jesus Christ. The term "nouthetic" derives from the Greek noutheteo, which means "to admonish or warn." Promoters of Calvinist fundamentalism introduced biblical counseling in the 1970s. Hybrids of the fundamentalist mode and folkloric "psychology" have largely superseded biblical counseling.
Biblical Nutrition	A way to view food, nutrition, diet, and health that, allegedly, is as old as the world. The inferences that constitute the core of Biblical Nutrition are: (1) that God has ÒordainedÓ a perfect eating plan for humans, and (2) that eating the ÒwrongÓ foods can lead to unnecessary illnesses and premature death. The principles of Biblical Nutrition include: (a) that the more processed a food is, the less biblical it is; (b) that one should never add manmade chemicals to foods; (c) that all foods should be Ògrown organically as much as possibleÓ; and (d) that one should strive to consume healthful foods named in the Bible.
Bikram Yoga	A purported means of reversing the process of aging. Bikram Choudhury (whose teacher was Paramahansa Yogananda's younger brother) "scientifically designed" the method.

It is related to bioenergetics. One of its postulates is that, when bodily fluids do not circulate efficiently or tissues are not "properly cleansed," "emotional tensions or blockages" show up and prevent "bioenergy" from vitalizing the body.
bioelectronic diagnosis	Form of ostensible diagnosis exemplified by radionic diagnosis. It involves using: (a) a tissue sample (e.g., blood, hair, or saliva), purportedly to "tune into" the patient's "vibrational state" ("rhythm"); and (b) "special instruments" that allegedly concentrate "the energy field."

(Bioenergetic Analysis, bioenergetic method)|Bioenergetic Analysis|bioenergetic method|bioenergetics	Offshoot of Reichian Therapy developed by psychiatrist Alexander Lowen (b. 1910), author of Language of the Body (1958). Its theory posits "bioenergy" ("life energy"), and its postulate is that all bodily cells record emotional or "energetic" reactions. Proponents hold that such cellular "memories" are adaptable to healing and consciousness-raising, and that patients can release them by crying, screaming, and kicking. Practitioners may be called "bioenergeticists." 2. "Science" practiced by former boxing instructor Yefim Shubentsov, called "The Russian" and "The Mad Russian."

The postulates of biogram therapy include the following. (a) One can learn how to use one's mind to correct any "negative physical conditions" in various areas of the body. (b) Everyone possesses a "cellular memory," the experience of one's ancestors in genetic code, which may cause otherwise inexplicable difficulties for the individual. (c) One can develop both the ability to "see" inside one's body with one's mind and the ability to derive information from one's "DNA archives" (the "Library of Time"), with which one can "retrain" oneself at the cellular level.

Will, and of Bioresonance and Multiresonance Therapy: New, Forward-Looking Forms of Therapy With Ultrafine Body Energies and Environmental Signals (Medicina Biologica, 1970), edited by Hans Brugemann. BRT stems partly from the work of Wilhelm Reich (see "orgone therapy" and "Reichian Therapy") and that of Reinhold Voll (see "Electroacupuncture According to Voll" and "electroacupuncture biofeedback"). Reportedly, Franz Morrel, a German medical doctor and Scientologist, and Erich Rasche, an electronics engineer, developed BRT, one of whose postulates is that tumors express the "holistic situation" in humans.
biorhythm	Allegedly scientific method developed separately by Viennese psychology professor Dr. Herman Swoboda (1873-1963) and Berlin physician William Fliess (1859-1928). It is a purported means of predicting human conditions and susceptibilities. Its postulate is that three fundamental biological cycles (biorhythms) are calculable from the date of one's birth. Swoboda and Fliess posited two cycles: (1) a "physical" cycle of 23 days, supposedly predictive of one's level of strength, coordination, immunity, and self-confidence; and (2) a "sensitivity" cycle of 28 days, allegedly predictive of emotional changes. In the 1920s, Austrian engineer Dr. Alfred Teltscher posited a third cycle, 33 days long and supposedly predictive of intellectual performance. According to proponents, "vital energy" is high on "positive" days and relatively low on "negative" days. George S. Thommen popularized biorhythm in Is This Your Day? (1973).

blood crystallization (diagnostic blood crystallization)|blood crystallization|diagnostic blood crystallization	Mode of ostensible diagnosis that involves introduction of a blood sample to a copper chloride solution. "Crystal signs" of illness in the resultant "blood-crystal picture" allegedly express the guidance of "a higher functional plane coming to expression." "Organ-signs," for example, purportedly indicate dysfunction of an organ or a bodily system.

Usually, the "healer" places his hands, palms down, on the top of the patient's head or on the shoulders or waist. Some proponents use the expressions "laying on of hands" and "touch therapy" interchangeably. The former expression may also refer specifically to the act of laying hands on a person's head to confer a spiritual blessing, as in Christian rites of confirmation and ordination.
Contact Reflex AnalysisSM (CRA)|CRA|Contact Reflex Analysis	Variation of applied kinesiology cofounded by Dick A. Versendaal, D.C., author of Contact Reflex Analysis and Designed Clinical Nutrition.

creative visualization	Subject of the bestseller of the same name, written by Shakti Gawain in 1978. (Gawain adopted the Sanskrit name "Shakti" in the 1970s and has defined it as "the feminine aspect of the god Shiva.") In creative visualization, one clearly imagines whatever one wants to "manifest" (see "manifesting"); then one (supposedly) gives the idea, image, or feeling "positive energy," by focusing on it regularly, until it becomes reality. Creative visualization's theory posits a "spiritual source": a "supply" of infinite energy, love, and wisdom discoverable in the "inner beings" of humans. <BR>Terms for methods identical or similar to creative visualization include: active imagination, creative imaging, directed day-dream, directed waking dream, dynamic imaging, guided fantasy, guided imagery, guided visualization, imagery, imaginal medicine, imaging, initiated symbol projection, inner guide meditation, led meditation, magickal visualization, mental imagery, pathworking, Positive Imaging, positive thinking, positive visualization, visualization, visualization therapy, waking dream therapy, and willed imagination.

cuy ritual (passing the cuy)|cuy ritual|passing the cuy	Ancient Andean variation of transference treatment. It involves prayer, rubbing a cuy (Andean guinea pig) over the "patient," killing the animal with a ritual knife, and purporting to read its entrails.

Young, Ph.D., D.Sc., author of Colloids of Light &amp; Life, Profiles of Microscopy, Sick &amp; Tired, and One Sickness--One Disease--One Treatment (1995). In the latter book, Young holds that mycosis, or fungal infection, or over-acidification of the body (or blood), is the only disease. He further holds that an "inverted" way of living and eating, especially excessive consumption of sugars and animal protein, causes such over-acidification. Daniel's Diet excludes all foods except avocados, lemons, limes, tomatoes, vegetables (e.g., buckwheat and soybeans), dark-green vegetable juice, tofu (bean curd), millet, "sprouted" or soaked seeds and nuts, oils, sea salt, herbal teas, specific dietary supplements (e.g., Pycnogenol(R)), and LiquidLightning Oxygen-O3 (a "formula" purportedly beneficial for "oxygen deprivation"). The diet is the namesake of a Jewish "prophet" and fortuneteller of the sixth century B.C.E.

The camera allegedly could produce photos of the "vital force fields" of objects and pictures of past events. The postulate of the de la Warr system is that the photographic qualities of the "force fields" of blood spots and tissue samples serve to characterize illness. De la Warr died in 1969.

Bradshaw is the author of: (a) Bradshaw On: The Family; (b) Healing the Shame That Binds You; (c) Homecoming: Reclaiming and Championing Your Inner Child; and (d) Creating Love: The Next Stage of Growth. In Homecoming, first published in 1990, Bradshaw states that all children of dysfunctional families lose their "I AMness": their assurance that their parents or guardians are healthy, able, and eager caregivers. He recommends that victims of this loss or "spiritual wound" reclaim their "inner child" by reliving their developmental stages and finishing "unfinished business." He terms such reclamation a Zenlike experience. Toward this end, he suggests having conversations with one's "inner infant," writing letters to it and reading them aloud, and writing letters to oneself--with the nondominant hand--as if the infant were writing them. Through such methods, the "wounded inner child" supposedly evolves into a "wonder child," which Bradshaw describes as one's "Imago Dei--the part of you that bears a likeness to your creator."

Johrei's principles include the "Law of Purification," which holds that sickness is simply "Nature's" way of restoring health, and the "Law of Spiritual Affinity," which holds that innumerable "spiritual cords" dominate human existence.

Its alleged design is to pinpoint allergens ("metabolic antagonists"), "measure" their "nutritional" neutralizers (e.g., herbs and homeopathic "remedies"), and "measure" nutrients that conduce to absorption of the neutralizers. The Lepore Technique of M.R.T. involves: (a) rubbing the thymus, purportedly to activate acupoints; and (b) rubbing "the mastoid gland behind both ears," purportedly to relax acupoints.

In an email message to Jack Raso dated June 29, 1999, Mr. Langner stated: <BR><BR> I never meant to defraud anyone! I was under the belief that I really could heal people, simply by laying my hands on them. I very soon discovered that this was not the case (because I was ineffective) and immediately stopped engaging in such practices. If that sounds a little nutty--well, maybe it was, but I swear to you I'm a sane individual (who used to have a nutty belief).<BR>All told, I had no more than 3 clients. I never made any medical claims--I was attempting to heal their "spirits" (as it were), not their physical bodies. Alas, the "healing" effect may have been no more than a temporary warm, fuzzy feeling, generated by one human being merely paying attention to another. I genuinely wanted to help people, not swindle them--and I was very disappointed when I realized that the "New Age skills" I had "developed" were no more than wishful thinking on my part. I soon stopped advertising (which was also ineffective, by the way) and just gave up the whole thing. I haven't done this sort of thing in years.... <BR>

In The Love-Powered Diet: When Willpower Is Not Enough (1992), Moran uses the expressions "God," "Goddess," "Higher Power," "Higher Self," "Love," "Nature," and "Spirit" interchangeably. The first principles of her system add up to: People with eating-related problems (e.g., bingeing) cannot resolve them on their own; with their permission, however, a "Higher Power" will "work some wonders" in their lives. Moran advises writing, praying, and talking casually to God and provides anthroposophical, Christian, Hindu, Native American, and Sikh prayers.

Its roots include Ayurveda ("the science of life") and Dhanur Veda (marma science, "the science of the battlefield"). The postulate of marma healing is that blockages in a system of 107 "energy channels" (marmas) in the human body: (a) unbalance doshas, the three (alleged) forces that govern health and longevity, and (b) thus create physical illness, chronic bodily conditions, mental instability, and emotional disorders.

For example, the letter "f" might represent the small and large intestines, which might symbolize the "Minister of Finance": The small intestine sorts out waste and the large intestine either eliminates or retains it. Thus, an ink-filled lower loop of the lowercase letter "f" supposedly is strong evidence of constipation due to a desire to hoard. Graphologists also consider the height, width, and slant of letters and the spacing between words and lines.
Medical Intuitive Analysis	Allegedly, the art of sensing where "health issues" are centered in the body and what is necessary for "positive" change.

St. John formulated physical, psychological, and temporal maps of "reflex points" on the feet. He claimed that these maps involve personal experiences predating conception.

Ehret's "formula of Life" is "V = P - O," where "V" stands for "vitality," "P" for the "power" that keeps one alive, and "O" for "obstruction": all "internal impurities." According to the system's theory, a beard is a "secondary sex organ," and "natural" love is the highest form of invisible nourishment from "the infinite" for body and soul.

Natural Hygiene (Hygienic Health System, Life Science)|Hygienic Health System|Life Science|Natural Hygiene	Variation of Nature Cure represented by proponents as the legacy of Sylvester Graham (1794-1851). Graham, the originator of the graham cracker, began his career as a Presbyterian minister and temperance lecturer. He professed the following. (a) Frequent involuntary discharges of semen presage debility. (b) Ingestion of "improper" foods or overeating cause seminal discharges. (c) Masturbation brings on pimples and potentially fatal sores. (d) Digestion entails an expenditure of vital force. (e) Diet is a means of economizing the vital force. (f) A diet is healthful if it narrowly prompts the digestive organs to function normally. According to "Hygienic" literature, the first "hygienic doctor" was Isaac Jennings, M.D. (1788-1874), who taught that obedience to "physical law" facilitates obedience to "moral law." Natural Hygiene's postulate is that disease is a process of "purification" and repair. The major "Hygienic" practices are fasting, food combining, and a form of veganism that emphasizes uncooked foods. Some "Professional Natural Hygienists" do not subscribe to food combining.

Network Spinal Analysis (Network, Network Chiropractic, Network Chiropractic Spinal Analysis)|Network|Network Chiropractic|Network Chiropractic Spinal Analysis|Network Spinal Analysis	Conspicuously vitalistic form of chiropractic founded in 1983 by Donald M. Epstein, D.C. It embraces the following principles. (a) An innate or "resident" intelligence ("inborn wisdom") governs all human biological processes through the nervous system and never harms the body. (b) This "intelligence" directs the life force ("vital life energy" or "vital life force"), which bestirs every cell. (c) Malposition of the spinal cord, nerves, and vertebrae can cause mechanical tension that may impede the "vital life force." (d) Mental and chemical stress can cause such mechanical tension. (e) Removing mechanical impediments to the "vital life force" heightens the operation of "innate intelligence" naturally. (f) The universe and society are intrinsically good.

neural therapy	Form of energy medicine (vibrational medicine) akin to acupuncture, developed in Germany circa 1930 by two brothers, Ferdinand and Walter Huneke (also spelled "Huehneke"). The Hunekes, both medical doctors, maintained that injections of local anesthetics into areas of "energy" disturbance ("interference fields") could relieve pain, immobility, and dysfunction. Injection sites include acupoints, scars, and the sites of old fractures or past infection. Purportedly, neural therapy energizes "short-circuited" cells and helps to regulate "biological energy." Proponents recommend it for hundreds of health problems.

Erickson, M.D., the originator of Ericksonian Hypnosis.) Advanced Neuro Dynamics, Inc., in Honolulu, Hawaii, has promoted a style of NLP that "recognizes the importance of the human spirit and its connection with the mind and body." Pure NLP(TM) is the brand of NLP promoted by The Society of Neuro-Linguistic Programming.
NeuroBioFeedback (NBF)|NBF|NeuroBioFeedback	Combination of biofeedback and "neural therapy." The Alexandria institute (Hastings-on-Hudson, New York) defines neural therapy as a "non-invasive, highly effective means to create efficient brain function using only light and sound." NBF is a purported way to create "healthy patterns of brain functioning." Its apparent postulate is that the mind and body can function well when the brain is "fit" and functioning well. Allegedly, NBF in conjunction with "sport psychology mental skills training techniques" may enable reaching "the ZONE" (see "Three Phase Workout") at will. One of NBF's major promoters is hypnotherapist and aromatherapist Bob Reese, A.T.C., C.P.P.T. ("Certified Peak Performance Trainer.").

The Ingham method emerged from the work of Eunice D. Ingham Stopfel (1879-1974), author of Stories the Feet Can Tell (1938), and her nephew Dwight C. Byer, author of Better Health with Foot Reflexology. Ingham developed a style of Foot Reflexology she called the "Ingham Reflex Method of Compression Massage."

Radiance Breathwork	Form of breathwork developed by university professor Gay Hendricks, Ph.D., and dance therapist Kathlyn Hendricks, Ph.D. (who obtained her doctorate from a nonaccredited institute). Purportedly, it: (a) releases "unresolved" emotions "held" in the body, (b) increases one's ability to handle "positive energy," (c) can "clear" the effects of birth trauma, and (d) can ultimately "connect" one to life's boundless transpersonal dimension.

radiesthesia (clairvoyant healing, medical dowsing, medical radiesthesia)|clairvoyant healing|medical dowsing|medical radiesthesia|radiesthesia	Method of ostensible diagnosis and treatment selection. The word "radiesthesia" is the anglicized form of radiesthesie, an apparent euphemism for "dowsing" coined by the Abbe Alex Bouly in 1927. It literally means "perception of radiation." Dowsing (see above; also called "biolocation") is a clairvoyant "art" centered on finding water, minerals, animals, missing persons, lost objects, or hidden treasure, usually with an instrument such as a pendulum or divining rod (a forked rod or tree branch, or a bent wire). "Radiesthesia" may refer to: (a) all forms of dowsing; (b) medical dowsing specifically; (c) dowsing and radionics; or (d) the ability to detect "biological radiations." Bouly and two other French priests--the Abbe Alexis Mermet and Father Jean Jurion--pioneered medical dowsing. Mermet's hypothesis was threefold: (1) everything emits radiation, (2) "some kind of current" flows through human hands, and (3) holding appropriate objects renders them revelatory tools. There are two basic "diagnostic" modes of radiesthesia: In one, practitioners supposedly detect and diagnose illness simply by passing their hands over the patient. In the other, they hold an "instrument" (see "pendular diagnosis") over the patient or over a sample of tissue or body fluids, a photograph of the patient, or one of the patient's belongings (e.g., an article of clothing). In the latter form of radiesthesia, practitioners base "diagnosis" on the movements of the "instrument." <BR>
radionic diagnosis (radionic analysis, radionic analysis technique, radionic diagnostic work)|radionic analysis|radionic analysis technique|radionic diagnosis|radionic diagnostic work	Form of remote diagnosis that involves using a "radionic diagnostic instrument." The basic modes of radionic diagnosis are the "stick pad" technique and a variation of telediagnosis.

radionic therapy (radionic healing, radionic treatment; called "radio therapy" in the 1930s)|radionic healing|radionic therapy|radionic treatment	Variation of absent healing that involves using a "radionic treatment instrument." Its postulate is that disease is a deviation from the body's "archetypal blueprint," which is perfect.
radionics (psionics)|psionics|radionics	Ill-defined offshoot of radiesthesia founded and named by San Francisco-born neurologist Albert Abrams, M.D., M.A. (1863-1924), author of Spondylotherapy (1910) and New Concepts of Diagnosis and Treatment (1916). Radionics, which encompasses radionic diagnosis and radionic therapy, is a combination of clairvoyant diagnosis, distant diagnosis (remote diagnosis), and psychic healing. Abrams associated different diseases with different radio waves supposedly emitted by various parts of the body and by tissue samples. He invented an ostensibly diagnostic electrical system whose components included: a "Dynamizer"--a receptacle for blood or tissue samples; three rheostats (devices that regulate electric current); and an electrode, which the practitioner would affix to the patient's forehead. Abrams claimed that one could even ascertain a patient's religion with his system, and that the patient's autograph could substitute for blood in the "Dynamizer." For "treatment," he recommended his "Oscilloclast": a device allegedly designed to emit curative vibrations.
Radix(TM) (Neo-Reichian Therapy, Radix neo-Reichian program of personal growth, Radixwork)|Neo-Reichian Therapy|Radix|Radixwork	Mode of body-centered psychotherapy developed by author and psychologist Charles (Chuck) R. Kelley, Ph.D., and his wife, Erica, in the 1960s and early 1970s. Radix borrows from Reichian Therapy the concepts of "life energy" and "muscular armor." According to its theory, muscle tension is the mechanism of volition and an access to one's life force. In Radix terminology, "radix" means "life force" or "life energy."
Rainbow Diet	A theistic form of vegetarianism, chakra healing, and color therapy advanced by Gabriel Cousens, M.D., a practitioner of auricular acupuncture, crystal healing, and homeopathy. Cousens is the author of Conscious Eating, Sevenfold Peace, and Spiritual Nutrition and The Rainbow Diet (1986). The Rainbow Diet's postulate is that every colored food--except flesh, fast food, junk food, frozen food, and irradiated food--"builds," "cleanses," "energizes," heals, and "rebalances" those glands, organs, and nerve centers associated with whichever major chakra is related to the food's surface color.
Raindrop Therapy	A combination of aromatherapy "science," massage, reflexology, and Vita Flex. Purportedly developed from the research of Dr. Gary Young and a Lakota medicine man, Raindrop Therapy is an alleged means of aligning bodily "energy centers." It features dropping allegedly antimicrobial essential oils toward the spine. One of its purported purposes is to bring "structural and electrical alignment" to the body.
Raktamoksha	Ayurvedic form of bloodletting. According to its theory, (a) "toxemia" is the "basic cause" of hypertension, "thrombotic elements," and repeated acne, eczema, herpetic symptoms, hives, leukoderma, and scabies; (b) pitta ("fire plus water," one of the three Ayurvedic "humors") is a derivative of disintegrated red blood cells in the liver; (c) an increase of pitta in the blood may cause many disorders; and (d) extraction of a small amount of venous blood relieves the "tension" caused by "pittagenic toxins" in the blood.
Rasayana therapy (Rasayana Ayurvedic Rejuvenation Therapy, the rejuvenation-Rasayana therapy)|Rasayana Ayurvedic Rejuvenation Therapy|Rasayana therapy|the rejuvenation-Rasayana therapy	A group of "special rejuvenation procedures" that have been used for centuries by Ayurvedic "physicians."

raw juice therapy	Purported "Natural" therapy expounded by John B. Lust. It centers on ingestion of juice extracted fresh, with electric juicers, from fruits and vegetables. Its purported design is to correct "colloidal cell chemical composition" that has become "unbalanced" because of "unnatural" habits. Unpleasant reactions to raw juice therapy allegedly indicate that the juices do not "harmonize" with an unhealthy gastrointestinal condition or with an "acid condition" of the blood; supposedly, such reactions are thus signs of improvement.
Ray methods of healing	Subject of Ray Methods of Healing (Samuel Weiser, Inc., 1993), by Zachary F. Lansdowne, Ph.D. The Ray methods of healing are a takeoff on the Seven Ray techniques (esoteric healing) and embrace homeopathy, Pranic Healing, raja yoga (astanga yoga), and white magic.

rei-so (spiritual diagnosis)|rei-so|spiritual diagnosis	Ostensibly diagnostic method whose apparent postulate is that dead people, in the form of spirits (interpretable as consciousness, energy, or vibration), can influence living people who had an intimate relationship with them. Supposedly, spirits create darkness in the "auras" of people they are affecting negatively.
Reich Blood Test	Ostensibly diagnostic component of orgonomic medicine (orgone therapy). The Reich Blood Test is a purported means of "ascertaining" overall "energetic health." Its postulate is that the morphology of erythrocytes indicates the "energetic state" of an organism at the time of their removal. Supposedly, red blood cells with "bions" (which resemble blue beads) at their center are abnormal. Proponents characterize bions as semi-living, bacterium-sized, vesicular manifestations of orgone and as the building blocks of cells.
Reichian breathwork	Purported aid to freeing "blocked energy" in the body.
Reichian Therapies (Reichian-based therapies, Reichian-oriented therapies)|Reichian Therapies|Reichian-based therapies|Reichian-oriented therapies	Variety of "regression methods" whose theories share Wilhelm Reich's concept of "character armoring" ("muscular-emotional armoring"). The expression "character armor" refers to all the attributes one supposedly develops as "blocking" against "emotional excitation." The alleged results of "character armoring" include bodily rigidity and "deadness." Reichian-oriented therapies include bioenergetics, core energetics, organismic psychotherapy, and Radix. (See "Reichian Therapy.")
Reichian Therapy (psychiatric orgone therapy, Reichian bodywork therapy, Reichian massage; called "vegetal therapy" in Europe)|Reichian Therapy|Reichian bodywork therapy|Reichian massage|psychiatric orgone therapy|vegetal therapy	Psychoanalytic form of bodywork developed by Wilhelm Reich (1897-1957), the "discoverer" of orgone (see "orgone therapy"). According to Reichian theory, blockages to orgone cause neuroses and most physical disorders. Muscular contractions ("body armor") in various parts of the body supposedly manifest such "blockages." The Reichian "therapist" intuitively decides where the greatest "body armor" is and supposedly seeks to "dissolve" or "dismantle" it. Approaches to "dissolving" this "armor" include massage and having the patient breathe deeply, cry, gag, kick, make faces, scream, and roll his or her eyes. Apparently, Reichian Therapy is also called "Reichian vegetotherapy."
Reiki [ray-key]|Reiki system|Usui Reiki|Usui method of Natural Healing|reiki healing|reiki therapy	(reiki healing, Reiki system, reiki therapy, Usui method of Natural Healing, Usui Reiki, Usui shiki ryoho, Usui shiko ryoho, Usui shiko ryoho system of healing, Usui System, Usui System of Natural Healing; formerly called "leiki"): A form of chakra healing and a variation of the laying on of hands. It encompasses Reiki I and a form of distant healing (absent healing). Dr. Mikao Usui "rediscovered" Reiki in the late 1800s, in Japan. Reiki "therapists" supposedly channel reiki, "universal life energy power," through their bodies for storage in the solar plexus, and into "dis-eased" individuals for "rebalancing." Reiki purportedly works simultaneously on emotional, mental, physical, and spiritual "levels" and does not have any limitations. The Reiki system's postulate is that activated "Sacred Universal Symbols" evoke "healing energies." The word "reiki" combines two Japanese expressions: rei, which means "spirit" or "soul," and ki ("energy," "life force").
Reiki-Alchemia(R)|Reiki-Alchemia	Union of Reiki and Alchemia.

Rolfing Movement Integration (RMI)|RMI|Rolfing Movement Integration	Spinoff of Rolfing whose groundwork was laid in the 1960s and 1970s by Dorothy Nolte (a Rolfer) and Judith Aston, the dancer who developed Aston-Patterning and Aston Movement. RMI somewhat resembles the Alexander Technique; both involve a "teacher" who gives tactile and oral guidance to a "student" (in the Alexander Technique, also called a "pupil"). An alleged effect of RMI is the experience of a "transformation of energy"--the release (very possibly "chaotic") of "energy" the body stored.
Rolfing(R) (Rolfing Method of Structural Integration, structural integration, structural processing)|Rolfing|Rolfing Method of Structural Integration|structural integration|structural processing	Form of myofascial massage that Ida P. Rolf, Ph.D. (1896-1979), developed in the 1930s in New York. Rolf was an organic chemist who had studied chiropractic and yoga. The Rolf Institute, in Boulder, Colorado, founded in 1971, quoted her in a pamphlet: "Rolfers make a life study of relating bodies and their fields to the earth and its gravity field, and we so organize the body that the gravity field can reinforce the body's energy field." Rolfing theory posits "muscle memory": recollection of an incident "held" or "recorded" in a particular part of the body. Rolfers adjust the massage when they supposedly detect areas of "energy imbalance" within the body. Proponents claim that one's posture reveals past traumatic experiences, that Rolfing effects emotional and "energetic" release, and that this alleged release restores the flow of "vital energy" and integrates mind and body.
Rosen Method (Rosen Method bodywork, Rosen Method psychospiritual bodywork)|Rosen Method|Rosen Method bodywork|Rosen Method psychospiritual bodywork	"Psycho-physical" system of bodywork developed in the 1970s by San Francisco physical therapist Marion Rosen, coauthor of The Rosen Method of Movement. It purportedly unlocks the unconscious and integrates body, mind, emotions, and spirit. The method reportedly involves "non-intrusive" touching, verbal interaction, and experiencing breath as the "gateway to awareness." A postulate of the Rosen Method is that the body protects one from painful past experiences by separating one from one's "essential self" ("true self"). Shortness of breath and chronic muscle tension supposedly manifest this alleged protection.
Rubenfeld Synergy(R) Method (Rubenfeld Synergy)|Rubenfeld Synergy|Rubenfeld Synergy Method	A form of body-centered psychotherapy that borrows from the Alexander Technique, the Feldenkrais Method, Gestalt therapy, and hypnotherapy.

In a nutshell, the principle of Seicho-No-Ie healing is that illness does not exist in "Reality" (the "true spiritual world" at the core of the phenomenal world) and that it is a false appearance. Apparently, "Seicho-No-Ie" literally means "House of Growth."
