Digital Transmission	In a digital telecommunication service, the original source is transformed into and transmitted as a series of digits in binary code (i.e. 0s or 1s). Voice, text, image or data are all equally capable of being coded as a digital signal, so that a single network can handle all four forms of transmission (multimedia). The string of binary digits can be abbreviated and then re-expanded on arrival, thus economising transmission capacity. Different strings of binary digits can be interleaved and transmitted together, thus permitting several separate conversations on a single line (multiplexing). The string of digits can be encrypted prior to transmission, to ensure a high level of information security and privacy. Through digitalization, even a severely degraded transmission can be reconstructed to reproduce perfectly the original source.

An interface can also be that which facilitates communication between two appliances (e.g. the PERITEL jack links a TV to a videotape recorder or a videodisc player).
Internet	The world's largest computer communication system, with an estimated 100-million users. Originated in the United States, though now operating world-wide, the Internet is a loose confederation of principally academic and research computer networks. It is not a network but rather the interconnection of thousands of separate networks using a common language. Developed by the Pentagon, the Internet first linked government agencies and colleges. Now the Net also connects thousands of companies and millions of individuals worldwide who subscribe to on-line services.
JET	<A href="http://www.jet.efda.org" target="_blank">Joint European Torus</A>. The JET Joint Undertaking was established in June 1978 to construct and operate the Joint EuropeanTorus, of its time the largest single project within the European nuclear fusion programme. It was coordinated by Euratom (the European Atomic Energy Community), and the JET project went on to become the flagship of the Community Fusion Programme and the first fusion facility in the world to achieve significant production of controlled fusion power in 1991. In 1997 JET achieved more than 16 MW fusion power in Deuterium-Tritium plasmas. JET has furthered fusion science well beyond the goals of the original Design Team and is now evolving into a physics and technology basis for preparing ITER, the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor.
