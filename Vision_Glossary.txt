ACCOMMODATION	The ability of the eye to change its focus from distant to near objects; process achieved by the lens changing its shape.
ANTERIOR CHAMBER	The space in front of the iris and behind the cornea.
AQUEOUS HUMOR (A-kwe-us)|aqueous-fluid|aqueous-humor	Clear, watery fluid that flows between and nourishes the lens and the cornea; secreted by the ciliary processes.
ASTIGMATISM (uh-STIG-muh-tizm)|astigmatism	A condition in which the surface of the cornea is not spherical; causes a blurred image to be received at the retina.
BINOCULAR VISION	The blending of the separate images seen by each eye into a single image; allows images to be seen with depth.
BLIND SPOT	(1) A small area of the retina where the optic nerve enters the eye; occurs normally in all eyes. <BR>(2) Any gap in the visual field corresponding to an area of the retina where no visual cells are present; associated with eye disease.
CENTRAL RETINAL ARTERY	The blood vessel that carries blood into eye; supplies nutrition to the retina.
CENTRAL RETINAL VEIN	The blood vessel that carries blood from the retina.
CHOROID (KOR-oyd)|choroid	The layer filled with blood vessels that nourishes the retina; part of the uvea.
CILIARY MUSCLES	The muscles that relax the zonules to enable the lens to change shape for focusing.
CILIARY PROCESSES	The extensions or projections of the ciliary body that secrete aqueous humor.
CONES|cone-cells	One type of specialized light-sensitive cells (photoreceptors) in the retina that provide sharp central vision and color vision. Also see RODS.
CONJUNCTIVA (KAHN-junk-TY-vuh)|conjunctiva	The thin, moist tissue (membrane) that lines the inner surfaces of the eyelids and the outer surface of the sclera.
CONTRAST SENSITIVITY	The ability to perceive differences between an object and its background.
CORNEA (KOR-nee-uh)|cornea	The outer, transparent, dome-like structure that covers the iris, pupil, and anterior chamber; part of eye's focusing system.
DILATION	A process by which the pupil is temporarily enlarged with special eye drops (mydriatic); allows the eye care specialist to better view the inside of the eye.
DRUSEN	Tiny yellow or white deposits in the retina or optic nerve head.
FLUORESCEIN ANGIOGRAPHY (FLOR-uh-seen an-jee-AHG-ruh-fee)|fluorescein-angiography	A test to examine blood vessels in the retina, choroid, and iris. A special dye is injected into a vein in the arm and pictures are taken as the dye passes through blood vessels in the eye.
FOVEA (FOH-vee-uh)|fovea	The central part of the macula that provides the sharpest vision.
FUNDUS	The interior lining of the eyeball, including the retina, optic disc, and macula; portion of the inner eye that can be seen during an eye examination by looking through the pupil.
HYPEROPIA (hy-pur-OH-pee-uh)|hyperopia	Farsightedness; ability to see distant objects more clearly than close objects; may be corrected with glasses or contact lenses.
INTRAOCULAR PRESSURE|iop	Pressure of the fluid inside the eye; normal IOP varies among individuals.
IRIS	The colored ring of tissue suspended behind the cornea and immediately in front of the lens; regulates the amount of light entering the eye by adjusting the size of the pupil.
LACRIMAL GLAND (LAK-rih-mul)|lacrimal-gland	The small almond-shaped structure that produces tears; located just above the outer corner of the eye.
LEGAL BLINDNESS	In the U.S., (1) visual acuity of 20/200 or worse in the better eye with corrective lenses (20/200 means that a person must be at 20 feet from an eye chart to see what a person with normal vision can see at 200 feet) or (2) visual field restricted to 20 degrees diameter or less (tunnel vision) in the better eye. NOTE: These criteria are used to determine eligibility for government disability benefits and do not necessarily indicate a person's ability to function.
LENS	The transparent, double convex (outward curve on both sides) structure suspended between the aqueous and vitreous; helps to focus light on the retina.
LOW VISION	Visual loss that cannot be corrected with eyeglasses or contact lenses and interferes with daily living activities.
MACULA (MAK-yoo-luh)|macula	The small, sensitive area of the central retina; provides vision for fine work and reading.
MYOPIA (my-OH-pee-uh)|myopia	Nearsightedness; ability to see close objects more clearly than distant objects; may be corrected with glasses or contact lenses.
OPTIC CUP	The white, cup-like area in the center of the optic disc.
OPTIC DISC/OPTIC NERVE HEAD|optic-disc|optic-nerve-head	The circular area (disc) where the optic nerve connects to the retina.
OPTIC NERVE	The bundle of over one million nerve fibers that carry visual messages from the retina to the brain.
PERIPHERAL VISION (per-IF-ur-al)|peripheral-vision	Side vision; ability to see objects and movement outside of the direct line of vision.
POSTERIOR CHAMBER	The space between the back of the iris and the front face of the vitreous; filled with aqueous fluid.
PRESBYOPIA (prez-bee-OH-pee-uh)|presbyopia	The gradual loss of the eye's ability to change focus (accommodation) for seeing near objects caused by the lens becoming less elastic; associated with aging; occurs in almost all people over age 45.
PUPIL	The adjustable opening at the center of the iris that allows varying amounts of light to enter the eye.
REFRACTION	A test to determine the best eyeglasses or contact lenses to correct a refractive error (myopia, hyperopia, or astigmatism).
RETINA (RET-in-nuh)|retina	The light-sensitive layer of tissue that lines the back of the eyeball; sends visual messages through the optic nerve to the brain.
RETINAL PIGMENT EPITHELIUM (RPE)(ep-ih-THEE-lee-um)|retinal-pigment-epithelium|rpe	The pigment cell layer that nourishes the retinal cells; located just outside the retina and attached to the choroid.
RODS|rod-cells	One type of specialized light-sensitive cells (photoreceptors) in the retina that provide side vision and the ability to see objects in dim light (night vision). Also see CONES.
SCHLEMM'S CANAL	The passageway for the aqueous fluid to leave the eye.
SCLERA (SKLEH-ruh)|sclera	The tough, white, outer layer (coat) of the eyeball; with the cornea, it protects the entire eyeball.
TONOMETRY	The standard to determine the fluid pressure inside the eye (intraocular pressure).
TRABECULAR MESHWORK (truh-BEC-yoo-lur)|trabecular-meshwork	The spongy, mesh-like tissue near the front of the eye that allows the aqueous fluid (humor) to flow to Schlemm's canal then out of the eye through ocular veins.
UVEA(YOO-vee-uh)|uveal-tract	The middle coat of the eyeball, consisting of the choroid in the back of the eye and the ciliary body and iris in the front of the eye.
VISUAL ACUITY|central-vision	The ability to distinguish details and shapes of objects; also called central vision.
VISUAL FIELD	The entire area that can be seen when the eye is forward, including peripheral vision.
VITREOUS (VIT-ree-us)|vitreous	The transparent, colorless mass of gel that lies behind lens and in front of retina.
ZONULES (ZAHN-yoolz)|zonules	The fibers that hold the lens suspended in position and enable it to change shape during accommodation.
