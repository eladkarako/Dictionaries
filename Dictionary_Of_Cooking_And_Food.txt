They must be softened by dipping in hot water for a few seconds and draining. Once softened they can be used to make fresh Vietnamese-style salad rolls or deep-fried spring rolls.
Rice stick noodles	Made from rice flour and water, these noodles are translucent when cooked. They are usually softened by soaking in hot water for 10 -15 minutes before cooking with other ingredients. Fine rice stick noodles can also be deep fried to create a crispy garnish often used in Chinese chicken salads.
Rice vinegar	Used in both Japanese and Chinese cooking, rice vinegar is made from fermented rice and comes in several varieties, each differing in intensity and tartness. In general they are all fairly mild compared to European and American-style vinegars. They can be used in dressings, marinades, as dipping sauces and condiments.
Ricotta	Ricotta is a soft, unripened Italian curd cheese. It is the by product of the whey of other cheeses. It is sweet in flavor and grainy in texture. Ricotta is used often in Italian sweets (most notably Cassata alla Sicilian) and in savory dishes as pasta stuffing.

Roasting, Peeling, and Seeding a Bell Pepper|Peeling|Peeling a bell pepper|Roasting|Roasting a Bell Pepper|Seeding|seeding a bell pepper	Many methods exist for roasting peppers. Among them are roasting them atop a stove, in an oven broiler, on a grill, and in hot oil. Using the broiler to roast peppers is my preferred method. I find it the least messy and lends itself to preparing large quantities. It is also the only one I have enough experience to explain in detail. Roasting: Preheat the oven broiler for 15 minutes. Place the peppers on the top rack (3-4 inches away from flame). Once a side has blackened., turn (with tongs, fork, towel, or other utensil). Repeat until all sides are blackened. If you are using this method for chili pepper, other than the bell pepper, you have to monitor closely so as only the skin and not the flesh of the pepper is charred. The bell pepper has a hardier skin and does not burn so easily. Peeling: Two different methods can be employed to peel a charred pepper. I personally prefer the first method. Place the peppers in a plastic or paper bag. Fold over the top of the bag, so no steam can escape. This way the steam will build up between the flesh and the skin, making peeling even easier. When the pepper is cool enough to handle (20 minutes), take out of the bag and peel the rest by hand. OR Submerge the charred pepper into a bowl of ice cold water. This will stop the cooking process and aid in the removal of the skin. Once the pepper is cool enough to handle, peel off the rest of the skin. Seeding: If you are going to be using the peppers whole, make a slit down one side, leaving a small space at both ends. Carefully remove the inside with a knife, small spoon, or one of those otherwise useless melon ballers. Otherwise, just remove the stem, remove the seeds and veins with your fingers, and rinse the pepper under water. Sometimes, I seed the pepper before it is charred, with no real difference in the final result.

Semisweet or bittersweet chocolate	This is the chocolate most often called for in cake and cookie recipes. 'Bittersweet' and 'semisweet' are often used interchangeably, though bittersweet generally has more chocolate 'liquor' (the paste formed from roasted, ground cocoa beans). Most semisweet chocolate contains at least 35% chocolate liquor, while some fine bittersweets contain 50% or more. Bittersweet and semisweet chocolate have a deep, smooth, intense flavor that comes from the blend of beans used rather than added dairy products.

Soy Sauce	Soy sauce is one of the world’s oldest condiments. Soybeans and wheat are blended and then yeast culture is added, along with water and salt, to create a mash, which ferments and ages like wine for several months to develop a rich, mellow flavor, aroma and delicate amber color. Once fermentation is complete, the resulting liquid is filtered, pasteurized and packaged. Non-brewed soy sauces are the result of a 20th-century short cut known as acid hydrolysis. There are critical differences between brewed and non-brewed soy sauces. Brewed soy sauce has a mellow, salty-sweet flavor, a subtle aroma and a delicate, transparent color - qualities that enhance other ingredients. The harsh, salty flavor of non-brewed soy sauce is one-dimensional, masking and overpowering other ingredients. Soy sauce can be used in entrees, pasta, pizza, soups, salads, sandwiches and more. Soy Sauce can balance and intensify the salty, sweet and tart flavors of other ingredients, acting as a natural flavor enhancer.

Their color ranges from the fresh green state to various stages of yellow to red in a ripened state. They are also sold dried and are often soaked in hot water before using.
Toasting Nuts	Toasting nuts brings the oils closer to the surface, bringing out the flavor. This is especially useful in low fat cooking, where you want to use less nuts, since they tend to be extremely high in fat. Toasting also makes removing the skins off of nuts easier. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. In an ungreased cookie sheet, spread the nuts in a single layer and let bake for 6 minutes. Remove from the oven. If you want to remove the skins from nuts, wrap the toasted nuts in a kitchen towel. Let the nuts steam for 5 minutes. Roll the nuts around (while still in towel) until skins rub off.

Whipping Cream	Consists of at least 35% milk fat content and is commercially produced by centrifugal separation. It is sometimes pasteurized but rarely homogenized. When whipped, it will double in volume and is not very likely to curdle. It is usually used to top desserts and piped over cakes. Here are some tips from the US dairy Association for perfect whipped cream: 1. Chill the bowl and beaters, preferably in the freezer if there' s space. The colder the bowl and beaters, the quicker the cream will whip. 2. Use a small, deep bowl for beating cream. 3. Beat rapidly, scraping the bowl occasionally. Do not overbeat. Beat only until soft or stiff peaks form, as called for in your recipe. 4. Whipped cream to be piped through a pastry tube for decoration should be stiffer than cream whipped to be folded into other ingredients. 5. Ultra-pasteurized whipping cream will take slightly longer to beat than regular whipping cream and will not overbeat as readily. 6. To make sweetened whipped cream, fold 2 to 3 tablespoons sifted confectioners' sugar or granulated sugar into 2 cups whipped cream, after beating. 7. One cup whipping cream yields 2 cups whipped cream.

Yogurt Cheese	Yogurt cheese can be eaten as a lowfat cream cheese substitute or as is most common as a lowfat alternative in baking. The final quality of the yogurt cheese is largely dependent on the yogurt you start out with, so try to use a good quality one. Considerable amounts of fat and calories can be cut out by using a low fat yogurt (use one without gelatin, like Dannon). To make: Pour yogurt into a cheesecloth and either let it hang over the kitchen sink or over a bowl. If you drain it over a bowl, you can do it in the refrigerator. Drain overnight. When the yogurt is firm, remove from the bag and transfer it to a separate container. Discard the liquid. Yogurt cheese keeps (refrigerated) for up to 1 week.
